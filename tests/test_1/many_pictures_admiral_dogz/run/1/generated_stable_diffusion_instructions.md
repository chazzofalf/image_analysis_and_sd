Okay, here's a breakdown of settings for InvokeAI based on your detailed description.  I'll explain the reasoning behind each choice.  This is geared towards getting a *high-quality, realistic, and atmospheric* image.

**Important Notes:**

*   **Model Choice:** I'm recommending a more realistic model.
*   **Experimentation:** These are *starting points*.  You'll likely need to tweak these settings to get *exactly* the look you want.  Pay attention to what changes produce the effects you're after.
*   **VRAM:**  This setup is geared towards higher resolutions and detail. Make sure you have enough VRAM (8GB+ recommended, 12GB+ preferred) to avoid crashes or slow generation.



## InvokeAI Settings:

**1. Positive Prompt:**

```
highly detailed futuristic spaceship bridge interior, panoramic view of Earth from orbit, lone astronaut in dark segmented spacesuit standing with back to viewer,  vibrant blue oceans, swirling white clouds, deep black space, dramatic lighting, strong linear perspective, matte black metallic structures, illuminated control console screens, volumetric lighting, cinematic, photorealistic, 8k, ultra detailed, crisp focus,  intricate details,  beautiful, epic scale, sense of isolation,  awe-inspiring, atmospheric,  science fiction art,  
```

*   **Key Elements:** We're emphasizing the key visual components (bridge, astronaut, Earth, etc.) and using descriptors that communicate the desired aesthetic (photorealistic, cinematic, epic scale, atmospheric).
*   **Detail Keywords:**  "Ultra detailed," "8k," "intricate details," and "crisp focus" tell the AI to prioritize high resolution and sharpness.
*   **Emphasis on Mood:** “Awe-inspiring, sense of isolation, atmospheric” help steer the AI towards the desired emotional impact.




**2. Negative Prompt:**

```
(worst quality, low quality:1.4), blurry, pixelated, artifacts, jpeg artifacts, overexposed, underexposed, saturated, cartoon, anime, painting, drawing, sketch, illustration,  text, watermark, signature, logo,  people, faces, visible eyes, helmet reflections, bright colors, smooth skin, excessive detail,  plastic texture,  bright lighting,  glow, reflections, oversmooth, unrealistic,  out of frame, deformed, mutated, distorted, bad anatomy, extra limbs, missing limbs,  
```

*   **Quality & Artifacts:**  "worst quality," "low quality," "blurry," "pixelated," "artifacts" are crucial for preventing low-quality outputs.  The ":1.4" increases the weight of these terms, making them more influential.
*   **Style & Medium:**  We're explicitly excluding artistic styles that don't match our goal (cartoon, anime, painting, etc.).
*   **Common Errors:**  "deformed," "mutated," "distorted," "bad anatomy," "extra limbs," "missing limbs" help prevent anatomical errors.
*   **Unwanted Effects:** "oversmooth" prevent overly soft, unrealistic textures. "reflections" can create unwanted shiny elements on the suit.
*   **Avoid unwanted elements:** The prompt excludes faces, to help keep the figure's back turned.

**3. Step Count:**

*   **50-70 Steps:**  This provides a good balance between quality and generation time.  Higher step counts can improve quality, but the gains diminish beyond this point.

**4. CFG Scale:**

*   **7-9:**  A good starting range.  Higher values force the AI to adhere more closely to the prompt, but can sometimes result in less creative or more artificial-looking images. 7 is a good starting point.

**5. Suggested Image Dimensions:**

*   **960x540 or 1280x720:**  These are good widescreen aspect ratios that will work well with the composition.  You can go higher (1920x1080, or even larger) if your VRAM allows, but be mindful of generation time.

**6. Model Suggestion:**

*   **Realistic Vision V5.1:** This model is excellent for generating photorealistic images with a focus on detail and quality.  It's a great choice for this scene.
*  **Deliberate V2:** A good alternative if you prefer a more versatile model.

**7. Scheduler Suggestion:**

*   **DPM++ 2M Karras:** This scheduler is known for producing high-quality, detailed images, and it works well with realistic models. It's a good balance between speed and quality.
*   **DPM++ SDE Karras:** Another excellent option, particularly if you want a slightly more artistic look.




**Additional Tips:**

*   **Seed:** Use a fixed seed to reproduce results or experiment with small variations.
*   **Batch Count/Size:**  Generate multiple images at once to explore different variations.
*   **Inpainting:** If you're not happy with a specific area of the image, use inpainting to refine it.
*   **Experiment with Prompt Weighting:**  Use parentheses to emphasize certain keywords or phrases (e.g., `(spacesuit:1.2)`).
*  **Use Img2Img:** If you have a base image, use it as a starting point with a low denoising strength to guide the generation process.



I hope this comprehensive breakdown helps you create the stunning image you envision!  Let me know if you have any further questions.
