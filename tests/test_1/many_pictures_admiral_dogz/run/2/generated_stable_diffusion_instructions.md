Okay, here's a breakdown suitable for recreating this image in InvokeAI, geared towards strong results.  I'll focus on getting the core concept right and providing enough detail for a good starting point.  This will be a complex prompt, so breaking it down into sections is key.

**Important Notes:**

*   **Model Choice:** SDXL 1.0 is *strongly* recommended. Its ability to handle complexity and detail is vastly superior to older models.  If you *must* use SD 1.5, you'll need to simplify the prompt significantly and expect lower fidelity.
*   **VAE:** Use a good VAE (Variational Autoencoder) with your chosen model.  'vae-ft-mse-840000-ema-pruned' is a solid choice for SDXL.
*   **Resolution:** Start with a high resolution.  1024x768 or 1024x1024 is a good starting point for SDXL.

## InvokeAI Prompt Breakdown

**1. Positive Prompt:** (This is long, but detailed is key)

```
masterpiece, best quality, ultra detailed, sci-fi spaceship bridge interior, panoramic view, large curved viewport, distant nebulae, blue planet, space battle debris, lone figure in dark spacesuit facing viewport, complex control panels, illuminated screens, recessed linear lights, subtle layering of domestic textures, blue textured blanket, dark green pillow, patterned pet bandana, animal fur, dog collar, melancholic atmosphere, cinematic lighting, dramatic perspective, volumetric lighting, highly detailed metallic surfaces, sleek minimalist architecture, glowing interfaces, HD, 8k, photorealistic
```

**2. Negative Prompt:** (This is *extremely* important for preventing muddiness and unwanted elements.  I'm being thorough.)

```
(worst quality, low quality:1.4), blurry, pixelated, jpeg artifacts, text, watermark, signature, logo, error, cropped, out of frame, duplicate, bad anatomy, deformed limbs, mutated hands, extra fingers, poorly drawn hands, bad eyes, unrealistic, cartoon, anime, illustration, painting, drawing, sketch, oversaturated, underexposed, flat lighting, low contrast, unrealistic skin texture, grain, noise, artifacts, simple background, empty space, floating objects, bright colors, human face visible, animal face visible, bright pet bandana, too much animal visible
```

**3. Step Count:**

*   **SDXL:** 50-75 steps.  SDXL benefits from more steps, but diminishing returns kick in.
*   **SD 1.5:** 40-60 steps (if you are using SD1.5)

**4. CFG Scale:**

*   **SDXL:** 7-10.  Lower values (7-8) generally give more creative freedom but might require more iterations. Higher values (9-10) give more adherence to the prompt but can be less creative.
*   **SD 1.5:** 7-9

**5. Suggested Image Dimensions:**

*   1024x768 (Landscape - works well for the panoramic view)
*   1024x1024 (Square - good if you want more emphasis on the verticality of the figure)

**6. Model & Scheduler:**

*   **Model:** SDXL 1.0 (Highly recommended).  Look for refined versions like 'SDXL_Refiner_v2' after you get a good base image.
*   **Scheduler:** DPM++ 2M Karras or DPM++ SDE Karras.  These are generally excellent for detailed images.

**7. Additional Tips & Refinement**

*   **Seed:** Experiment with different seeds. A good seed can drastically improve the outcome.
*   **Regional Prompting:**  Consider using regional prompting in InvokeAI to give more specific instructions for different areas of the image. For example, you could create a region for the figure to specify the spacesuit details, and another for the background to focus on the cosmic scene.
*   **Inpainting:** Use inpainting to refine specific areas, like adding more detail to the spacesuit or subtly enhancing the domestic textures.
*   **Img2Img:**  Start with a base image (perhaps a simple sketch or a generated image with a different style) and use img2img to guide the generation process.  This can give you more control over the overall composition.
*   **LoRAs/Textual Inversion:** If you're familiar with them, LoRAs or textual inversions could be used to refine specific aspects, such as the spacesuit design or the texture of the blanket.



**Explanation of Key Prompt Choices:**

*   **"masterpiece, best quality, ultra detailed"**: These are standard quality boosters.
*   **Specific details**: The prompt includes specific details about materials (metallic, polymer), textures (smooth, plush), and lighting (volumetric, cinematic).
*   **"melancholic atmosphere"**:  This helps to capture the desired emotional tone.
*   **Negative prompt detail**: The negative prompt is crucial for preventing unwanted elements and ensuring a high-quality result.  I've included common issues like bad anatomy and artistic styles to avoid.




This is a complex image to generate, so expect to iterate and refine the prompt multiple times. Don't be afraid to experiment and adjust the settings to achieve the desired result. Good luck!
