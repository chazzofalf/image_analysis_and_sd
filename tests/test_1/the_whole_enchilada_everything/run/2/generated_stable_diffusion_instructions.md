Okay, this is an interesting challenge! We need to translate a *description of a story* (and an implied image) into InvokeAI prompt parameters. The core of the image is described as vast ocean, turbulent storms, power, and vulnerability. The story emphasizes a female leader, weaving, ancient cultures, and a sense of healing. Here's a breakdown of how to approach this in InvokeAI:

## InvokeAI Parameters for Recreating the Essence of the Story

**1. Positive Prompt:**

```
epic fantasy, vast ocean, turbulent storm, powerful female leader, Zethana, intricate weaving, ancient coastal culture, weathered stone structures, dramatic lighting, glowing bioluminescence, swirling tides,  detailed clothing, flowing hair, determined expression,  healing energy, sense of hope,  powerful symbolism,  high detail,  art by Artgerm and Alphonse Mucha, cinematic, digital painting, photorealistic, 8k
```

**Explanation:**

*   **Core Concepts:**  "Vast ocean", "Turbulent storm", "powerful female leader" are central.
*   **Character & Culture:** "Zethana" (naming the protagonist helps focus the AI), "intricate weaving", "ancient coastal culture" establish the setting and themes.
*   **Visual Details:** "weathered stone structures", "glowing bioluminescence", "swirling tides", "detailed clothing", "flowing hair" add richness.
*   **Emotional Tone:** "determined expression", "healing energy", "sense of hope" inject the desired feeling.
*   **Artistic Style:** "art by Artgerm and Alphonse Mucha" – Artgerm for modern detailed fantasy, Mucha for flowing lines, organic patterns and a sense of ethereal beauty.
*   **Technical:** "cinematic, digital painting, photorealistic, 8k" – Aim for high resolution and detail.

**2. Negative Prompt:**

```
cartoon, anime, manga, illustration, sketch, low quality, blurry, pixelated, artifacts, oversaturated, deformed, disfigured, bad anatomy, poorly drawn hands, extra limbs, mutation, text, watermark, signature, simple background, flat colors, unrealistic, modern architecture, robots, sci-fi, futuristic,  children, gore, violence,  excessive cleavage,  plastic skin, jpeg artifacts, noisy, grainy, dull colors, unrealistic proportions, bad eyes, discolored hair,  overexposed, underexposed
```

**Explanation:**

This is *extensive* because we want to steer the AI away from anything that doesn't fit the intended aesthetic.  It's crucial to:

*   **Avoid Stylization:**  No cartoonish, anime, or simple styles.
*   **Prevent Technical Issues:** No low quality, blurriness, artifacts.
*   **Fix Anatomy:**  Specifically call out bad anatomy/hands (a common AI issue).
*   **Eliminate Unwanted Elements:**  Remove anything that would clash with the ancient/fantasy setting (robots, sci-fi).
*   **Control Content:** No violence, gore, or overly sexualized depictions.
* **Color and lighting control:** Remove issues related to color and exposure.

**3. Step Count:**

*   **60-80 steps:**  This allows for good detail and refinement without taking *too* long. More steps can improve quality, but diminishing returns set in.

**4. CFG Scale:**

*   **7-9:**  A good balance between following the prompt and allowing the AI some creative freedom. Lower values will be more creative, higher more strict to the prompt.

**5. Suggested Image Dimensions:**

*   **768x1024 or 1024x768 (portrait) or 1024x1024 (square):** These are good starting points for a detailed character and environment.  Wider aspect ratios could emphasize the vast ocean, but a portrait orientation feels more fitting for a character-focused image.

**6. Stable Diffusion Model & Scheduler:**

*   **Model:** **Deliberate v2** or **Realistic Vision v5.1** or **Protogen x5.8** - These models excel at detailed, realistic fantasy imagery. Deliberate is very well-rounded, Realistic Vision has stunning realism, and Protogen is great for character work.
*   **Scheduler:** **DPM++ 2M Karras** or **Euler a** – Both are excellent schedulers. DPM++ 2M Karras tends to produce more detailed and consistent images, while Euler a is faster and can be more creative.



**Important Considerations and Iteration:**

*   **Seed:** Experiment with different seeds to find variations you like.
*   **Regional Prompting:**  Use regional prompting (if your InvokeAI version supports it) to further refine specific areas of the image (e.g., focus detail on Zethana's face and clothing).
*   **Img2Img:**  If you have a base image that captures the mood, use img2img with a low denoising strength to guide the AI.
* **Vary Prompt Weight:**  Experiment with parentheses `()` and brackets `[]` to emphasize and de-emphasize parts of the prompt.  For example: `(Zethana:1.2)` would give more weight to the Zethana part of the prompt.



This is a starting point. Achieving the exact vision will require experimentation and fine-tuning of the parameters.  The goal is to capture the *feeling* and *themes* of the story in a visually compelling way.  Good luck!
