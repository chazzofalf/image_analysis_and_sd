Okay, here's a breakdown of the information to recreate this scene in InvokeAI. This is geared toward a high level of detail and artistic interpretation.  I'm aiming for something that feels epic and emotionally resonant, leaning towards a painterly/digital painting style.

**Overall Aesthetic Goal:** Dramatic, Epic, Painterly/Digital Painting, Dark Fantasy/Sci-Fi Blend.  Think Brom, Frank Frazetta meets Moebius.



**1. Positive Prompt:**

```
a colossal, impossibly tall obsidian spire, pulsating with inner luminescence, intricate scale-like texture, dark fantasy, sci-fi, a sleek silver and cerulean blue starfighter caught mid-maneuver, dramatic lighting, a tall, slender Witch Queen with indigo skin, flowing garments of shadow and starlight, silver hair, glowing eyes, ethereal beauty, a moment of revelation, reversed memories, fragmented flashbacks of opulent palaces, bustling marketplaces, serene mountains, fierce battlefields, swirling energy,  a nobleman in silks, dying in snow, a kiss of farewell,  intricate detail, dramatic composition, highly detailed,  painterly, digital painting, art by Brom and Moebius, masterpiece, cinematic lighting, volumetric lighting
```

**2. Negative Prompt:** (This is *extensive* because we want to avoid common AI pitfalls and ensure fidelity.  Be prepared to tweak this. This is where a lot of the work is.)

```
(worst quality, low quality:1.4), blurry, jpeg artifacts, pixelated, distorted, deformed, bad anatomy, bad hands, extra fingers, missing fingers, long neck, mutated hands, poorly drawn face, poorly drawn hands, ugly, tiling, text, watermark, signature, logo, error, cropped, out of frame, draft, amateur, simple background, monochrome, greyscale, realistic, photorealistic, 3d render, CGI, (people, humans, faces, bodies), cartoon, anime, illustration, sketch, (bright colors), oversaturated,  (flat lighting), (simple shadows), (lack of detail), (duplicate elements), (low contrast), (bad proportions), (plastic texture), (shiny skin),  (excessive bloom), (motion blur), (grainy), (disfigured), (mutated), (unrealistic anatomy), (unnatural poses), (low resolution),  (text), (logos), (watermarks), (signatures), (symbols), (comic book style), (vector art), (clipart), (poorly drawn eyes), (closed eyes), (multiple eyes), (disfigured eyes), (dead eyes), (unnatural skin texture), (artificial lighting), (generic sci-fi)
```

**3. Step Count:** 60-80 (For this level of detail, we need sufficient steps.  Experiment to find the sweet spot.)

**4. CFG Scale:** 7-9 (Higher values push the AI closer to the prompt, but can introduce artifacts.  I'd start around 7.5 and adjust.)

**5. Suggested Image Dimensions:**

*   **16:9 Aspect Ratio:** 1024x576 or 1280x720. (Good for cinematic feel.)
*   **Square:** 896x896 or 1024x1024 (For a more compositional and dramatic shot)

**6. Stable Diffusion Model:**

*   **Deliberate:** Excellent for detailed fantasy art and character work.
*   **DreamShaper:**  Strong for painterly style and vibrant colors.
*   **Realistic Vision V5.1**: Provides a good base for details with enough flexibility to move towards painterly.
*   **Protogen X5.8**: A good all-rounder, leaning towards realistic but with artistic potential.

**7. Scheduler:**

*   **Euler A:**  Generally good for painterly styles and complex scenes.
*   **DPM++ 2M Karras:**  Excellent for detail and sharpness.
*   **DPM++ SDE Karras:**  Smoother and can produce more artistic results. (Try this one if you are getting too much noise.)

**8. Additional Tips/Considerations:**

*   **Inpainting:**  This scene will likely benefit *greatly* from inpainting.  Focus on the faces, hands, and details of the spire to refine them.
*   **Regional Prompting:** Use InvokeAI's regional prompting to strengthen certain areas. For example, emphasize detail and complexity around the Witch Queen and the Spire.
*   **ControlNet:**  Consider using ControlNet (especially Canny or Depth) to guide the composition and structure of the Spire and the overall scene.
*   **Seed:**  Experiment with different seeds to find variations you like.  Once you find a seed you like, iterate on it.
*   **Iterate:** Don't expect perfect results on the first try.  This is a complex prompt. Be prepared to experiment with the settings and prompt to achieve the desired look.
*   **Break it down**: Consider generating the elements separately (the Spire, the fighter, the Witch Queen) and then compositing them together in an image editor for maximum control.

**Final Thoughts:**  This is a challenging but rewarding prompt.  The key is to be patient, experiment, and iterate.  Good luck! Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these points.
