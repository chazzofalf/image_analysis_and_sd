Okay, here's a breakdown of parameters to recreate this scene in InvokeAI, aiming for a high level of detail and fidelity.  This is ambitious, so expect some iteration!

**Overall Approach:** This will require a model known for detail, especially in faces and complex textures. We'll lean heavily on a detailed negative prompt to avoid common AI artifacts and ensure the desired aesthetic.  I'm suggesting a mix of photorealism and painterly style to capture the epic, slightly surreal quality.



**1. Positive Prompt:**

```
epic scene, 31st century starfighter in battle, dark spire chamber, colossal obsidian structure, hyperspatial geometry, The Favored One, ethereal humanoid figure, nebula skin, flowing violet and indigo, ancient jewelry, shadow garments, intricate details, dynamic composition, starfighter bracing for impact, energy blasts, shimmering distortions, translucent hull, cascading memories, swirling nebula, golden light, embrace, profound sadness, ancient power, volumetric lighting, dramatic shadows, painterly style, photorealistic details, masterpiece, high resolution, 8k, highly detailed, complex composition, otherworldly, sci-fi fantasy
```

**2. Negative Prompt (Extremely Detailed â€“ Key to Success):**

```
lowres, blurry, pixelated, jpeg artifacts, signature, watermark, text, error, cropped, worst quality, low quality, normal quality, grayscale, monochrome, ugly, tiling, poorly drawn hands, poorly drawn feet, poorly drawn face, out of frame, extra limbs, disfigured, deformed, body out of frame, bad anatomy, mutated, extra fingers, extra arms, duplicate, cloned, repetitive, unrealistic, oversaturated, under saturated, boring, flat, simple background, generic, cartoonish, anime, 3d render, plastic texture, CGI, bad proportions, unrealistic lighting, dull colors, grainy, noise, artifacts, too bright, too dark, out of focus, washed out,  amateur, childish, simple, bland, abstract, unrealistic skin,  bad eyes, closed eyes, missing limbs, extra digits, bad teeth, unnatural pose, weird anatomy, flat shading, harsh shadows, visible brushstrokes, distorted, uncanny valley, low detail,  
```

**3. Step Count:**

*   **60-80 steps:**  This will provide enough detail to realize the intricate aspects of the scene without taking an excessively long time to render.  More steps *could* help, but the diminishing returns may not be worth the extra time.

**4. CFG Scale:**

*   **7-9:** A higher CFG scale (closer to 9) will force the AI to adhere more closely to your prompt, which is important for such a complex scene.  However, pushing it *too* high can introduce artifacts. Experiment within this range.

**5. Suggested Image Dimensions:**

*   **1024x768 or 1024x1024:** These are good starting points.  Going much larger will significantly increase render time and require more VRAM.  You can upscale after generating a base image if needed.  Square aspect ratio often works well for complex compositions.

**6. Stable Diffusion Model & Scheduler:**

*   **Model:**  **Deliberate V2** or **Realistic Vision V6.0** are excellent choices. These models are known for their ability to generate detailed, photorealistic images with good rendering of faces and complex textures.  Alternatively, **Dreamshaper XL** can produce beautiful, detailed outputs with a slightly more painterly style.
*   **Scheduler:** **DPM++ 2M Karras** is a solid all-around scheduler that produces high-quality results. **Euler a** can also be good, particularly for painterly styles, but might require more tweaking.

**Additional Tips and Considerations:**

*   **Seed:**  Experiment with different seeds to get variations on the composition.  Once you find a composition you like, use the seed to refine it.
*   **Regional Prompting/Inpainting:**  InvokeAI's regional prompting features will be *invaluable* for refining specific areas of the image (e.g., the Favored One's face, the details on the starfighter).
*   **Img2Img (Image to Image):** Consider using a base image (perhaps a concept sketch or a simplified render) as a starting point and then using Img2Img to refine it with your prompts.
*   **Iterate!**  This is a complex scene.  You will likely need to generate many images and refine your prompts to achieve the desired result.
*   **Pay attention to the Negative Prompt:**  The negative prompt is just as important as the positive prompt in controlling the output.



Good luck! This is a challenging but rewarding project.  Let me know if you have any questions as you work through it.
