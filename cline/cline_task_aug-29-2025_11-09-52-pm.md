<task>
Encapsulate everything under the if __name__ == "__main__" block inside of image_describer.py by placing it inside of a main(...) function that takes one input parameter.

# TODO LIST RECOMMENDED
When starting a new task, it is recommended to create a todo list.




1. Include the task_progress parameter in your next tool call

2. Create a comprehensive checklist of all steps needed

3. Use markdown format: - [ ] for incomplete, - [x] for complete



**Benefits of creating a todo list now:**

	- Clear roadmap for implementation

	- Progress tracking throughout the task

	- Nothing gets forgotten or missed

	- Users can see, monitor, and edit the plan



**Example structure:**
```

- [ ] Analyze requirements

- [ ] Set up necessary files

- [ ] Implement main functionality

- [ ] Handle edge cases

- [ ] Test the implementation

- [ ] Verify results
```



Keeping the todo list updated helps track progress and ensures nothing is missed.

- [x] Read image_describer.py
- [x] Refactor __main__ block into a main function
- [x] Verify implementation
</task_progress>
<result>
The `image_describer.py` script has been refactored as requested. All logic previously under the `if __name__ == "__main__"` block is now encapsulated in a new `main(image_path)` function that accepts a single input parameter. The entry point now simply parses command‑line arguments and calls `main` with the provided image path.
