# TODO LIST RECOMMENDED
When starting a new task, it is recommended to create a todo list.




1. Include the task_progress parameter in your next tool call

2. Create a comprehensive checklist of all steps needed

3. Use markdown format: - [ ] for incomplete, - [x] for complete



**Benefits of creating a todo list now:**

	- Clear roadmap for implementation

	- Progress tracking throughout the task

	- Nothing gets forgotten or missed

	- Users can see, monitor, and edit the plan



**Example structure:**
```

- [ ] Analyze requirements

- [ ] Set up necessary files

- [ ] Implement main functionality

- [ ] Handle edge cases

- [ ] Test the implementation

- [ ] Verify results
```



Keeping the todo list updated helps track progress and ensures nothing is missed.
