# Todo List (Optional - Plan Mode)



While in PLAN MODE, if you've outlined concrete steps or requirements for the user, you may include a preliminary todo list using the task_progress parameter.

Reminder on how to use the task_progress parameter:



1. To create or update a todo list, include the task_progress parameter in the next tool call

2. Review each item and update its status:

   - Mark completed items with: - [x]

   - Keep incomplete items as: - [ ]

   - Add new items if you discover additional steps

3. Modify the list as needed:

		- Add any new steps you've discovered

		- Reorder if the sequence has changed

4. Ensure the list accurately reflects the current state



**Remember:** Keeping the todo list updated helps track progress and ensures nothing is missed.

PLAN MODE
In this mode you should focus on information gathering, asking questions, and architecting a solution. Once you have a plan, use the plan_mode_respond tool to engage in a conversational back and forth with the user. Do not use the plan_mode_respond tool until you've gathered all the information you need e.g. with read_file or ask_followup_question.
(Remember: If it seems the user wants you to use tools only available in Act Mode, you should ask the user to "toggle to Act mode" (use those words) - they will have to manually do this themselves with the Plan/Act toggle button below. You do not have the ability to switch to Act Mode yourself, and must wait for the user to do it themselves once they are satisfied with the plan. You also cannot present an option to toggle to Act mode, as this will be something you need to direct the user to do manually themselves.)

PLAN MODE
In this mode you should focus on information gathering, asking questions, and architecting a solution. Once you have a plan, use the plan_mode_respond tool to engage in a conversational back and forth with the user. Do not use the plan_mode_respond tool until you've gathered all the information you need e.g. with read_file or ask_followup_question.
(Remember: If it seems the user wants you to use tools only available in Act Mode, you should ask the user to "toggle to Act mode" (use those words) - they will have to manually do this themselves with the Plan/Act toggle button below. You do not have the ability to switch to Act Mode yourself, and must wait for the user to do it themselves once they are satisfied with the plan. You also cannot present an option to toggle to Act mode, as this will be something you need to direct the user to do manually themselves.)

# Todo List (Optional - Plan Mode)



While in PLAN MODE, if you've outlined concrete steps or requirements for the user, you may include a preliminary todo list using the task_progress parameter.

Reminder on how to use the task_progress parameter:



1. To create or update a todo list, include the task_progress parameter in the next tool call

2. Review each item and update its status:

   - Mark completed items with: - [x]

   - Keep incomplete items as: - [ ]

   - Add new items if you discover additional steps

3. Modify the list as needed:

		- Add any new steps you've discovered

		- Reorder if the sequence has changed

4. Ensure the list accurately reflects the current state



**Remember:** Keeping the todo list updated helps track progress and ensures nothing is missed.

# Current Mode
PLAN MODE
In this mode you should focus on information gathering, asking questions, and architecting a solution. Once you have a plan, use the plan_mode_respond tool to engage in a conversational back and forth with the user. Do not use the plan_mode_respond tool until you've gathered all the information you need e.g. with read_file or ask_followup_question.
(Remember: If it seems the user wants you to use tools only available in Act Mode, you should ask the user to "toggle to Act mode" (use those words) - they will have to manually do this themselves with the Plan/Act toggle button below. You do not have the ability to switch to Act Mode yourself, and must wait for the user to do it themselves once they are satisfied with the plan. You also cannot present an option to toggle to Act mode, as this will be something you need to direct the user to do manually themselves.)

Tool [write_to_file] was not executed because a tool has already been used in this message. Only one tool may be used per message. You must assess the first tool's result before proceeding to use the next tool.


# Todo List (Optional - Plan Mode)



While in PLAN MODE, if you've outlined concrete steps or requirements for the user, you may include a preliminary todo list using the task_progress parameter.

Reminder on how to use the task_progress parameter:



1. To create or update a todo list, include the task_progress parameter in the next tool call

2. Review each item and update its status:

   - Mark completed items with: - [x]

   - Keep incomplete items as: - [ ]

   - Add new items if you discover additional steps

3. Modify the list as needed:

		- Add any new steps you've discovered

		- Reorder if the sequence has changed

4. Ensure the list accurately reflects the current state



**Remember:** Keeping the todo list updated helps track progress and ensures nothing is missed.

In this mode you should focus on information gathering, asking questions, and architecting a solution. Once you have a plan, use the plan_mode_respond tool to engage in a conversational back and forth with the user. Do not use the plan_mode_respond tool until you've gathered all the information you need e.g. with read_file or ask_followup_question.
(Remember: If it seems the user wants you to use tools only available in Act Mode, you should ask the user to "toggle to Act mode" (use those words) - they will have to manually do this themselves with the Plan/Act toggle button below. You do not have the ability to switch to Act Mode yourself, and must wait for the user to do it themselves once they are satisfied with the plan. You also cannot present an option to toggle to Act mode, as this will be something you need to direct the user to do manually themselves.)

Tool [write_to_file] was not executed because a tool has already been used in this message. Only one tool may be used per message. You must assess the first tool's result before proceeding to use the next tool.


# Todo List (Optional - Plan Mode)



While in PLAN MODE, if you've outlined concrete steps or requirements for the user, you may include a preliminary todo list using the task_progress parameter.

Reminder on how to use the task_progress parameter:



1. To create or update a todo list, include the task_progress parameter in the next tool call

2. Review each item and update its status:

   - Mark completed items with: - [x]

   - Keep incomplete items as: - [ ]

   - Add new items if you discover additional steps

3. Modify the list as needed:

		- Add any new steps you've discovered

		- Reorder if the sequence has changed

4. Ensure the list accurately reflects the current state



**Remember:** Keeping the todo list updated helps track progress and ensures nothing is missed.

# Todo List (Optional - Plan Mode)



While in PLAN MODE, if you've outlined concrete steps or requirements for the user, you may include a preliminary todo list using the task_progress parameter.

Reminder on how to use the task_progress parameter:



1. To create or update a todo list, include the task_progress parameter in the next tool call

2. Review each item and update its status:

   - Mark completed items with: - [x]

   - Keep incomplete items as: - [ ]

   - Add new items if you discover additional steps

3. Modify the list as needed:

		- Add any new steps you've discovered

		- Reorder if the sequence has changed

4. Ensure the list accurately reflects the current state



**Remember:** Keeping the todo list updated helps track progress and ensures nothing is missed.

While in PLAN MODE, if you've outlined concrete steps or requirements for the user, you may include a preliminary todo list using the task_progress parameter.

Reminder on how to use the task_progress parameter:



1. To create or update a todo list, include the task_progress parameter in the next tool call

2. Review each item and update its status:

   - Mark completed items with: - [x]

   - Keep incomplete items as: - [ ]

   - Add new items if you discover additional steps

3. Modify the list as needed:

		- Add any new steps you've discovered

		- Reorder if the sequence has changed

4. Ensure the list accurately reflects the current state



**Remember:** Keeping the todo list updated helps track progress and ensures nothing is missed.

# Current Mode
PLAN MODE
In this mode you should focus on information gathering, asking questions, and architecting a solution. Once you have a plan, use the plan_mode_respond tool to engage in a conversational back and forth with the user. Do not use the plan_mode_respond tool until you've gathered all the information you need e.g. with read_file or ask_followup_question.
(Remember: If it seems the user wants you to use tools only available in Act Mode, you should ask the user to "toggle to Act mode" (use those words) - they will have to manually do this themselves with the Plan/Act toggle button below. You do not have the ability to switch to Act Mode yourself, and must wait for the user to do it themselves once they are satisfied with the plan. You also cannot present an option to toggle to Act mode, as this will be something you need to direct the user to do manually themselves.)
