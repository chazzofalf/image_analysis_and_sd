This is no longer working. The ollama manifests seem to have been removed as part of a update to ollama. Figure out another way to list the ollama models.

# TODO LIST RECOMMENDED
When starting a new task, it is recommended to create a todo list.




1. Include the task_progress parameter in your next tool call

2. Create a comprehensive checklist of all steps needed

3. Use markdown format: - [ ] for incomplete, - [x] for complete



**Benefits of creating a todo list now:**

	- Clear roadmap for implementation

	- Progress tracking throughout the task

	- Nothing gets forgotten or missed

	- Users can see, monitor, and edit the plan



**Example structure:**
```

- [ ] Analyze requirements

- [ ] Set up necessary files

- [ ] Implement main functionality

- [ ] Handle edge cases

- [ ] Test the implementation

- [ ] Verify results
```



Keeping the todo list updated helps track progress and ensures nothing is missed.

**Assistant:**

Okay, I understand. The Ollama manifests are no longer available, so I need to find another way to list the available models. I will investigate alternative methods to achieve this.

Here's a plan to address this issue:

- [ ] Investigate the `ollama list` command as a potential alternative.
- [ ] If `ollama list` is not available or doesn't provide sufficient information, explore the `ollama show` command to gather details about individual models.
- [ ] If neither command works, research the Ollama API to determine if there's a programmatic way to retrieve the model list.
- [ ] Implement a solution to retrieve the model list using the chosen method.
- [ ] Update the `OllamaToGGUF.py` script to use the new method for listing models.
- [ ] Test the updated script to ensure it correctly lists the available models.

Now, I'll start by checking if the `ollama list` command is available and functional.

```tool_use
<execute_command>
<command>ollama list</command>
<requires_approval>false</requires_approval>
<task_progress>
