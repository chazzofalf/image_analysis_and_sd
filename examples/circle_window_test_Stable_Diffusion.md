Thinking...
The user asked: "Based on the following image description, provide information suitable for recreating it in InvokeAI. Include the following: Positive Prompt, Negative Prompt, Step Count, CFG Scale, Suggested Image Dimensions, and an idea on the best stable diffusion model to use and the best scheduler: Thinking..."

We need to output the prompt details for InvokeAI based on the image description we just gave? Actually the user wants to recreate the image in InvokeAI. We have to provide positive prompt, negative prompt, step count, CFG scale, dimensions, model recommendation, scheduler.

We should base on the description: a circular window with metal/wood frame, water, bubbles, blurred background, UI elements, people, rug, decorative metal circles, etc.

Positive prompt: detailed description with many adjectives. Negative prompt: typical things like lowres, blurry, jpeg artifacts, text, watermark, etc. Steps: maybe 30-50. CFG scale: around 7-9. Dimensions: maybe 1024x1024 to preserve circle. Model: Stable Diffusion XL (sdxl) or the latest, maybe "stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0". Scheduler: DPM++ 2M Karras or Euler a.

Provide them in a nice format.

Let's produce final.
...done thinking.

**InvokeAI Generation Settings for ‚Äúcircle_window_test.jpg‚Äù**

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| **Positive Prompt** | **A hyper‚Äërealistic, ultra‚Äësharp photograph of a perfectly round circular window set in a mixed metal‚Äëand‚Äëwood frame. The rim is weathered gray metal with patches of corrosion, while sections of the frame show light‚Äëcolored wooden grain. Inside the glass, clear water clings to the lower half, shimmering with dozens of delicate translucent bubbles that catch a soft, diffused back‚Äëlight. Through the glass the background is a smooth, velvety blur of dark gray/black, isolating the window. Across the lower right of the pane the filename ‚Äúcircle_window_test.jpg‚Äù is rendered in a clean sans‚Äëserif font, as if overlaid from a UI screenshot. Around the window a faint glow outlines the rim, giving an underwater‚Äëlike ambience. In the foreground lies a low‚Äëpile rectangular rug in muted beige/gray tones, grounding the scene. Three casually dressed people are partially visible near the window, their silhouettes softened by the shallow depth of field. To the side of the composition a large decorative metal window displays a pattern of concentric circles of varying sizes. In the lower left corner a tiny red speck and a black rectangle containing a bright yellow circle labeled ‚Äútest‚Äù appear, while the bottom‚Äëright shows a blue circle with the text ‚Äúgreen test‚Äù. The overall color palette is restrained: cool grays, soft silvers, muted whites, with subtle accents of blue, green, yellow and a hint of red. The lighting is even, diffused, and slightly back‚Äëlit, creating a calm, experimental studio feel.** |
| **Negative Prompt** | **low‚Äëresolution, blurry, out‚Äëof‚Äëfocus, jpeg artifacts, watermark, text overlay distortion, over‚Äëexposed, under‚Äëexposed, noise, grainy, cartoon, painting, illustration, sketch, drawing, low‚Äëdetail, deformed anatomy, extra limbs, missing fingers, disfigured face, bad anatomy, bad proportions, ugly, duplicate, glitch, glitchy, compression artifacts, NSFW, nudity** |
| **Steps** | **45** |
| **CFG Scale** | **7.5** |
| **Image Dimensions** | **1024‚ÄØ√ó‚ÄØ1024‚ÄØpx** (square format keeps the circular window centered and undistorted) |
| **Recommended Model** | **Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL) ‚Äì `stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0`** (or the latest ‚Äúsdxl‚Äëturbo‚Äù variant for faster iteration) |
| **Best Scheduler** | **DPM++ 2M Karras** (offers crisp detail and excellent handling of fine textures like water bubbles and metal grain) |

### Quick Tips for a Successful Render
1. **Start with a lower step count (30‚Äë35) to preview composition**, then increase to 45‚ÄØ+ for the final high‚Äëquality image.  
2. **If the metallic frame looks too smooth**, add a tiny weight to ‚Äúweathered metal, corrosion, rust‚Äù in the prompt.  
3. **To emphasize the UI overlay**, you can optionally add ‚Äúdigital overlay, UI screenshot, crisp text‚Äù with a small weight (‚âà0.3) after the main prompt.  
4. **Use the ‚Äúseed‚Äù option** (e.g., `seed=123456789`) to reproduce results exactly if you need to iterate.  

Happy generating! üöÄ
