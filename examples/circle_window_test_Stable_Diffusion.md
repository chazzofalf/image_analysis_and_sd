Thinking...
We need to produce information for recreating in InvokeAI: Positive Prompt, Negative Prompt, Step Count, CFG Scale, Suggested Image Dimensions, and best stable diffusion model and scheduler. Based on description. Provide prompts.

Positive prompt: include "circular window, frosted glass, round window, light beige wall, modern minimalist interior, soft natural daylight, diffused light, plush gray sofa, textured fabric, blue and orange throw pillows, dark blue patterned blanket, light-colored blanket, white curtain, white wall hanging, low coffee table, plush gray rug, soft shadows, warm inviting atmosphere, high detail, photorealistic, 8k, cinematic lighting".

Negative: "blurred, lowres, jpeg artifacts, deformed anatomy, extra limbs, text, watermark, signature, cropped, distorted perspective, overexposed, harsh shadows, clutter, busy background, unrealistic colors, cartoon, painting".

Step count: maybe 30-45 steps (common). Choose 30 or 45. Use 30 for faster but quality. Provide suggestion: 45 steps for higher fidelity.

CFG scale: typical 7-12. Choose 8-9. Provide 8.5.

Dimensions: Suggest 1024x1024 square to keep window centered, or 768x1024 portrait to capture vertical window and sofa. Probably 1024x1024 works. Or 1152x896? Provide suggestion 1024x1024.

Best model: stable diffusion XL 1.0 or 1.0 base, or "Stable Diffusion XL 1.0" for high detail and photorealism. Or "Stable Diffusion 2.1" also good. But for photorealistic interior, "SDXL 1.0" is best.

Scheduler: DPM++ 2M Karras or Euler a. Use "DPM++ 2M Karras" for high quality.

Now produce final answer with sections.
...done thinking.

**🖼️  QUICK‑START SETTINGS FOR RE‑CREATING THE “Circular‑Window Cozy Interior” in InvokeAI**

| Item | Recommendation |
|------|-----------------|
| **Stable‑Diffusion model** | **Stable Diffusion XL 1.0 (or XL 1.0 Base)** – best for photorealistic interiors, fine‑grained lighting and material detail. |
| **Scheduler** | **DPM++ 2M Karras** (or DPM++ 2M SDE Karras) – gives a clean, noise‑free result with smooth gradients in the diffused daylight. |
| **Steps** | **45 steps** – enough for high‑frequency detail (fabric texture, frosted‑glass grid) while still being reasonably fast. |
| **CFG scale** | **8.5** – strong enough to keep the composition tight (window‑sofa relationship) but still allows subtle colour‑pop (orange pillow) to emerge. |
| **Image size** | **1024 × 1024 px** (square) – centers the circular window and lets the sofa and surrounding décor fill the frame without cropping.  <br>*(If you prefer a more “portrait‑style” view of the tall window, try 768 × 1024 px.)* |
| **Sampler** | **Euler‑a** is also fine if you want a slightly softer look; keep DPM++ 2M Karras as the default for crispness. |

## ✅  Positive Prompt (what *must* be in the picture)

```
circular frosted glass window, round window with white grid of small square panes, soft diffused natural daylight streaming in, light beige matte wall, modern minimalist interior, plush gray/gray‑blue sofa with textured fabric, low‑profile couch, relaxed throw pillows in blue, white and orange, dark blue patterned blanket with white/light‑blue geometric motifs draped over back, light‑colored (muted green/beige/gray) soft blanket, white sheer curtain edge on left, white abstract circular wall hanging, low coffee table with a small vase of fresh flowers and a book, plush gray rug, subtle warm shadows, calm inviting atmosphere, high‑detail, photorealistic, 8k, cinematic lighting, ultra‑sharp focus, clean composition, interior design, cozy living space
```

*Tips:*  
- Keep the **order** roughly from “architectural element → lighting → main furniture → accessories → mood”.  
- Use commas (`,`) to separate concepts; the model treats each as a separate token weight.  
- If you want extra emphasis on the frosted‑glass effect, add **“frosted glass texture”** or **“light‑diffusing pane”** near the window description.

## ❌  Negative Prompt (what *must NOT* appear)

```
low‑resolution, blurry, out‑of‑focus, jpeg artifacts, watermark, signature, text, logo, deformed anatomy, extra limbs, cartoon, illustration, painting, sketch, oil painting, unrealistic colors, oversaturated, overexposed, harsh shadows, strong direct sunlight, cluttered background, too many decorative items, busy composition, tilted perspective, cropped edges, distorted proportions, lens flare, grainy, noise, vignette
```

*Why these?*  
- They suppress typical diffusion artefacts (watermarks, text, JPEG blocks).  
- They keep the look strictly **photorealistic** (no cartoon/painting styles).  
- They prevent **hard shadows** that would break the soft, diffused daylight vibe.

### 🎯  Quick “One‑Click” InvokeAI command (for reference)

```bash
invokeai \
  --model "stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0" \
  --prompt_file prompts.txt \
  --sampler "dpmpp_2m_karras" \
  --steps 45 \
  --cfg 8.5 \
  --width 1024 --height 1024 \
  --seed -1 \
  --output_dir ./outputs
```

*`prompts.txt`* should contain the **Positive Prompt** on the first line, then a line starting with `negative:` followed by the **Negative Prompt**.

## 📌  Final Tips for the Best Result

1. **Seed control** – set a fixed seed (e.g., `12345`) if you want reproducibility; otherwise leave `-1` for a random seed each run.  
2. **Upscaling** – after generation, run the built‑in **Real‑ESRGAN x4** or **Stable Diffusion Upscaler** if you need >2 K resolution.  
3. **Fine‑tuning** – if the window’s frosted grid looks too sharp, add the phrase **“soft focus on glass”** or increase the negative weight for “sharp edges”.  
4. **Variations** – try swapping **“orange pillow”** for “burnt‑orange” or **“muted green blanket”** for “sage‑green” to explore subtle colour shifts while keeping the overall mood.

Enjoy rendering your serene, light‑filled interior! 🌞🪟🛋️
