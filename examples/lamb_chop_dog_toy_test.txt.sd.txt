Thinking...
We need to produce information suitable for recreating it in InvokeAI: Positive Prompt, Negative Prompt, Step Count, CFG Scale, Suggested Image Dimensions, best stable diffusion model, best scheduler. Use the description to craft prompts.

Positive prompt should include details: close-up plush lamb dog toy, bright lighting, soft focus background, creamy white fur, pink embroidered smile, dark button eyes, slight tilt, frayed stitching, small tear, collar with tag, signs of wear, etc.

Negative prompt: avoid extra elements, blur, cartoonish style, unrealistic colors, extra animals, etc. Avoid low quality, oversaturation, bad anatomy, etc.

Step count typical 30-50, maybe 40. CFG Scale maybe 7-8. Dimensions: 512x512 or 768x768 for more detail. Suggest 768x768.

Best model: stable diffusion 2.1 or 2.0? For realistic plush, maybe "Stable Diffusion XL 1.0" or "sdxl" for high fidelity. Or "Stable Diffusion 2.1 base" with photorealistic. Could also recommend "Realistic Vision V5.1" for product photography. But for plush toy, maybe "SDXL 1.0" with photorealism.

Scheduler: "Euler a" or "DPM++ 2M SDE Karras". Usually Euler a works for detail. Suggest DPM++ 2M SDE Karras for high quality.

Provide in a clean format.

...done thinking.

## 1. Prompt (Positive)

```
close‑up portrait of a plush lamb‑shaped dog toy, modeled on the classic Lamb Chop puppet, creamy off‑white velvety fur, soft high‑pile fabric, dark glossy button eyes (one slightly askew), wide pink embroidered smile, floppy long ears with a small tear on the right ear, light brown/gray thin collar with a tiny metal tag, subtle stains of drool around mouth and eyes, frayed stitching and a faint rip near the ear, slightly flattened stuffing, head tilted right as if about to bite, bright even studio lighting, soft diffuse shadows, shallow depth of field with a gently blurred indoor floor background, warm nostalgic mood, photorealistic product‑catalog style, high detail, 8k‑like texture, subtle wear and tear that tells a story.
```

*Tips:*  
- Keep the **order** of adjectives roughly as written; the model tends to respect earlier descriptors.  
- If you want a **black‑and‑white** version, add “black and white, high‑contrast, grayscale” at the end of the prompt.

## 2. Prompt (Negative)

```
cartoon, illustration, flat shading, comic, anime, low‑poly, abstract, unrealistic colors, over‑saturation, extra background objects, other toys, humans, pets, text, watermark, logo, blurry, low‑resolution, jpeg artifacts, noisy, grainy, over‑sharpened, deformed anatomy, extra limbs, missing eyes, plastic, metal, glass, ceramic, glossy plastic sheen, studio backdrop with lights, harsh shadows, strong rim lighting, lens flare, HDR, neon, pastel, pastel‑colored fur, unrealistic fur pattern, double exposure, duplicated elements, text overlay
```

## 3. Sampling Settings  

| Setting                | Recommended Value |
|------------------------|-------------------|
| **Steps**              | **40** (30–50 works as well) |
| **CFG Scale**          | **7.5** (range 7‑9) |
| **Sampler / Scheduler**| **DPM++ 2M SDE Karras** (excellent for fine texture) <br>*or* **Euler‑a** if you prefer a slightly faster run with comparable detail |
| **Seed**               | Random (or set a fixed seed for reproducibility) |
| **Batch size**         | 1 |
| **Precision**          | fp16 (or fp32 if your GPU can handle it) |

---

## 4. Image Dimensions  

- **Preferred size:** **768 × 768 px** – gives enough pixel real‑estate for the fine stitching, fur nap, and subtle wear while staying comfortably within most GPU VRAM limits.  
- If you have abundant VRAM (≥ 12 GB) you can go **1024 × 1024 px** for an even crisper result.

---

## 5. Model Recommendation  

| Model | Why it fits |
|-------|-------------|
| **Stable Diffusion XL 1.0** (official) | XL is tuned for photorealistic detail, excellent at rendering fabrics, subtle lighting, and realistic textures—perfect for a plush‑toy close‑up. |
| **Alternative (if you prefer a “product‑photo” vibe)**: **Realistic Vision V5.1** (or **V2.0**) | Specifically trained on product‑catalog images; great at clean lighting and material realism. |
| **If you want a more “illustrated‑but‑realistic” look**: **DreamShaper XL** | Balances realism with a slight stylized softness that matches the nostalgic feel of the original. |

*Pick one model and keep the others as fall‑backs for experimentation.*

## 6. Quick “One‑Line” Command (for InvokeAI CLI)

```bash
invokeai --prompt "close‑up portrait of a plush lamb‑shaped dog toy, modeled on the classic Lamb Chop puppet, creamy off‑white velvety fur, soft high‑pile fabric, dark glossy button eyes (one slightly askew), wide pink embroidered smile, floppy long ears with a small tear on the right ear, light brown/gray thin collar with a tiny metal tag, subtle stains of drool around mouth and eyes, frayed stitching and a faint rip near the ear, slightly flattened stuffing, head tilted right as if about to bite, bright even studio lighting, soft diffuse shadows, shallow depth of field with a gently blurred indoor floor background, warm nostalgic mood, photorealistic product‑catalog style, high detail, 8k‑like texture, subtle wear and tear that tells a story." \
--negative_prompt "cartoon, illustration, flat shading, anime, low‑poly, abstract, unrealistic colors, over‑saturation, extra background objects, other toys, humans, pets, text, watermark, logo, blurry, low‑resolution, jpeg artifacts, noisy, grainy, over‑sharpened, deformed anatomy, extra limbs, missing eyes, plastic, metal, glass, ceramic, glossy plastic sheen, studio backdrop with lights, harsh shadows, strong rim lighting, lens flare, HDR, neon, pastel, pastel‑colored fur, unrealistic fur pattern, double exposure, duplicated elements, text overlay" \
--sampler "dpm++_2m_sde_karras" \
--steps 40 \
--cfg 7.5 \
--width 768 --height 768 \
--model "stable-diffusion-xl-1.0" \
--seed 12345678
```

*(Adjust seed, model name, or dimensions as needed.)*

### Final Note  

The prompt and negative prompt together capture **every visual cue** described in the source image: the plush texture, the subtle wear, the tiny collar & tag, the head‑tilt, the bright diffused lighting, and the soft blurred background. Using **SD‑XL** (or a high‑quality product‑photo model) with the **DPM++ 2M SDE Karras** scheduler at **40 steps** and **CFG ≈ 7.5** will give you a faithful, high‑detail recreation that can be easily tweaked for either a full‑color or classic black‑and‑white rendition. Happy generating!
