Thinking...
The user wants: "Based on the following image description, provide information suitable for recreating it in InvokeAI. Include the following: Positive Prompt, Negative Prompt, Step Count, CFG Scale, Suggested Image Dimensions, and an idea on the best stable diffusion model to use and the best scheduler."

So after the exhaustive description, we need to give prompts etc. The description we already produced can be used to craft a positive prompt. Let's propose:

Positive Prompt: "through a dark window frame, view of a quiet urban street, gray asphalt road, light concrete sidewalks, modern muted‑tone buildings, single leafy tree, lamppost, few parked cars, a city bus in the distance, two pedestrians walking, a third person standing, overcast daytime sky, soft diffused lighting, subtle reflections on glass, low‑contrast, realistic photography, 35mm lens, shallow depth of field, high detail, cinematic composition, watermark text outside_window_streetview_test in lower left"

Negative Prompt: "cartoon, anime, illustration, low detail, blurry, overexposed, night, rain, snow, fog, people in costume, futuristic vehicles, neon lights, exaggerated colors, text overlays other than watermark, HDR, lens flare, unrealistic perspective, motion blur, low resolution"

Step Count: maybe 30-50 steps, typical 30-45. Use CFG scale ~7-8. Dimensions: 768x512 or 1024x768 to keep aspect ratio (window on left). Could be 768x512 (3:2). Or 1024x768 (4:3). Choose 768x512 (portrait? Actually width > height). The image seems landscape orientation, maybe 1024x640. We'll suggest 1024x640 (16:10). Or 768x512 (3:2). Provide suggestion.

Model: Stable Diffusion XL 1.0 or 2.1? Since we need realistic photography with good details, use "Stable Diffusion 2.1 base" or "Stable Diffusion XL 1.0" (which is good for photorealism). Scheduler: DPM++ 2M Karras or Euler a for high detail. Suggest DPM++ 2M SDE Karras for smoother.

Provide final answer.
...done thinking.

**InvokeAI Settings for “outside_window_streetview_test”**

---

### ✅ Positive Prompt  
```
through a dark window frame, looking out onto a quiet urban street, gray asphalt road, light concrete sidewalks, modern muted‑tone buildings of beige and gray, single fully leafed‑out tree, metal lamppost, three parked cars (subtle colors), a city bus in the distance, two pedestrians walking side‑by‑side, a third person standing on the sidewalk, overcast daytime sky with soft diffused light, subtle reflections on the glass, low‑contrast realistic photography, 35 mm lens, shallow depth of field, cinematic composition, high detail, realistic texture, slight peephole distortion, watermark text "outside_window_streetview_test" in lower left corner
```

### ❌ Negative Prompt  
```
cartoon, anime, illustration, low detail, blurry, out‑of‑focus, night, rain, snow, heavy fog, neon lights, futuristic vehicles, sci‑fi, surreal, HDR, lens flare, motion blur, exaggerated colors, pastel palette, watercolor, oil painting, sketch, line art, text overlay other than the watermark, low‑resolution, pixelated, grainy, deformed perspective, people in costume, vintage filter
```

### 🏃‍♂️ Sampling Parameters  
| Parameter | Recommended Value |
|-----------|-------------------|
| **Steps** | **35‑45** (35 is a solid default; increase to 45 for extra fine detail) |
| **CFG Scale** | **7.5 – 8.0** (balances adherence to prompt with creative freedom) |
| **Sampler / Scheduler** | **DPM++ 2M Karras** (or **Euler‑a** if you prefer slightly faster generation) |
| **Seed** | Random (or set a fixed seed for reproducibility) |
| **Batch size** | 1 (single image) |

### 📐 Suggested Image Dimensions  
The composition is landscape with the window occupying roughly the left‑third of the frame. A 3:2 or 16:10 aspect works well:

- **1024 × 640** (16 : 10) – preserves the wide view while keeping the window prominent.  
- **768 × 512** (3 : 2) – a slightly tighter crop if you prefer a more classic photographic ratio.

Both sizes are well‑supported by the default SD‑XL and SD‑2.1 models.

### 🤖 Best Stable‑Diffusion Model  
- **Stable Diffusion XL 1.0 (SD‑XL 1.0)** – excellent for photorealistic scenes, handles complex lighting and subtle reflections nicely.  
- If you prefer a lighter model with comparable realism, **Stable Diffusion 2.1‑base** also works well, especially when paired with the DPM++ 2M Karras scheduler.

### 📚 Quick‑Start Command (InvokeAI CLI)  
```bash
invokeai \
  --prompt "through a dark window frame, looking out onto a quiet urban street, gray asphalt road, light concrete sidewalks, modern muted‑tone buildings of beige and gray, single fully leafed‑out tree, metal lamppost, three parked cars, a city bus in the distance, two pedestrians walking side‑by‑side, a third person standing on the sidewalk, overcast daytime sky with soft diffused light, subtle reflections on the glass, low‑contrast realistic photography, 35mm lens, shallow depth of field, cinematic composition, high detail, realistic texture, slight peephole distortion, watermark text \"outside_window_streetview_test\" in lower left corner" \
  --negative_prompt "cartoon, anime, illustration, low detail, blurry, night, rain, snow, heavy fog, neon lights, futuristic vehicles, HDR, lens flare, motion blur, exaggerated colors, pastel palette, watercolor, oil painting, sketch, line art, text overlay other than the watermark, low‑resolution, pixelated, deformed perspective, people in costume, vintage filter" \
  --sampler "dpmpp_2m_karras" \
  --steps 40 \
  --cfg_scale 8.0 \
  --width 1024 --height 640 \
  --model "stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0"
```

Feel free to tweak the **CFG scale**, **step count**, or **dimensions** to match your hardware constraints or artistic preferences. Happy rendering!
