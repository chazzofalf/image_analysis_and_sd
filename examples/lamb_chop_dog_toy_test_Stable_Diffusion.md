Thinking...
We need to provide information suitable for recreating it in InvokeAI: Positive Prompt, Negative Prompt, Step Count, CFG Scale, Suggested Image Dimensions, best stable diffusion model, best scheduler. Also include the detailed description? The user asked: "Based on the following image description, provide information suitable for recreating it in InvokeAI. Include the following: Positive Prompt, Negative Prompt, Step Count, CFG Scale, Suggested Image Dimensions, and an idea on the best stable diffusion model to use and the best scheduler: Thinking...". So we need to output those items, likely based on the description we derived. So we should craft a positive prompt capturing all elements, a negative prompt to avoid undesired things (blur, cartoon, low-res, extra limbs, etc). Provide step count (e.g., 30-45). CFG scale typical 7-12. Dimensions maybe 768x1024 (portrait) or 1024x768? Since central toy, maybe 768x1024. Provide model suggestion: e.g., Stable Diffusion XL 1.0 or 1.0 base, or SD 2.1, or Dreamlike Photoreal 2.0. Best scheduler: DPM++ 2M Karras or Euler a. Probably DPM++ 2M SDE Karras for detail. Provide recommended seeds? Not asked.

We'll also include a brief rationale.

Let's craft final answer.
...done thinking.

**Stable‑Diffusion “recipe” for the described scene**

| Item | Recommendation |
|------|----------------|
| **Positive Prompt** | `high‑detail photo of a plush toy that looks like a white lamb‑chop dog, soft velvety fur, bright red ears and head, pink button nose, glossy black bead eyes, slightly worn, lying on its side on a textured beige fabric cushion/ottoman, soft natural warm lighting, gentle shadows, indoor setting, cozy living‑room / workshop hybrid, tufted neutral‑colour armchair in the background, round dark‑wood table to the left with a white cloth, open hardcover book, black remote control, clear glass of water, crumpled white plastic bag, small black object, faint metal grate on the floor, light‑brown low‑pile carpet, neutral off‑white wall, slightly elevated camera angle, 8k‑style realism, ultra‑sharp focus, subtle depth of field` |
| **Negative Prompt** | `low‑resolution, blurry, out‑of‑focus, cartoon, anime, illustration, painting, text, watermark, signature, logo, extra limbs, duplicated objects, unrealistic colors, over‑saturation, harsh shadows, strong directional light, neon, sci‑fi, futuristic, metallic surfaces, glossy plastic, grainy, noise, JPEG artifacts, lens flare, motion blur, extreme tilt, perspective distortion, missing fur texture, cloth stretching, unrealistic anatomy` |
| **Steps** | **35–45** (35 works well for most SD‑XL runs; increase to 45 if you want a little extra fine‑detail on the plush fibers and fabric texture) |
| **CFG Scale** | **7.5 – 9** (7.5 gives a good balance of prompt adherence and creativity; 9 if you need the toy’s red‑head details to be rock‑solid) |
| **Image Dimensions** | **768 × 1024** (portrait orientation – the toy is the vertical focal point; you can also try **1024 × 768** if you prefer a landscape framing that shows more of the table) |
| **Recommended Model** | **Stable Diffusion XL 1.0** (or the newer **Stable Diffusion XL‑Turbo 1.0** if you want faster generation with still‑excellent detail).  SD‑XL’s 1024‑pixel latent space handles the subtle fur‑texture, fabric weave and realistic lighting far better than SD‑1.5 or SD‑2.1. |
| **Best Scheduler** | **DPM++ 2M Karras** (or **DPM++ SDE Karras**).  These samplers give the sharpest micro‑detail on soft materials (fur, cloth) and produce a clean, low‑noise depth‑of‑field look. |
| **Seed (optional)** | Any seed you like – if you want reproducibility start with a simple integer like **123456789**. |
| **Tips / Rationale** | • The prompt is deliberately long and descriptive to force the model to render every element (toy, red ears, fabric, table props, metal grate, lighting).  <br>• The negative prompt removes common “artistic” shortcuts (cartoon, anime, low‑res) that SD‑XL sometimes falls back to when the prompt is very detailed.  <br>• 35–45 steps with DPM++ 2M Karras give crisp fur strands and a realistic soft‑light fall‑off without excessive sampling time.  <br>• Using the XL model (1024‑pixel latent) ensures the fine details of the plush texture and the subtle shadows on the fabric are captured.  <br>• The portrait ratio (768×1024) mirrors the natural way a photographer would frame a standing‑toy on a cushion with the surrounding furniture, while still leaving enough room for the table and background elements. |
