Thinking...
Now need to output final answer with Positive Prompt, Negative Prompt, Step Count, CFG Scale, Suggested Image Dimensions, best model and scheduler. Use the description to craft prompts.

Positive Prompt: include details: black and white running shoes, teal accents, on red wooden table, next to book, soft diffused lighting, shallow depth of field, urban sidewalk background with people, shoe testing rig with metal clamps and digital readout, neutral background, high detail, realistic photography, 8k, etc.

Negative Prompt: avoid blur, distortion, lowres, watermark, text, oversaturation, unrealistic colors, cartoon, etc.

Step count typical 30-50. Use 45 steps. CFG Scale maybe 7.0.

Dimensions: 1024x1024 or 768x1024? For detailed composition maybe 1024x1024. Or 1152x896? Suggest 1024x1152 to capture vertical orientation? The scene is slightly elevated and includes background; could be portrait orientation. Choose 768x1024 (portrait). Provide suggestion.

Model: best stable diffusion model: "stable-diffusion-xl-v1.0" or "sdxl base 1.0". Also "Flux.1" maybe. But for photorealistic product with detailed background, SDXL 1.0 is good. Also "Stable Diffusion 2.1" can do but less. So recommend SDXL 1.0. Scheduler: DPM++ 2M SDE Karras or Euler a. For sharp details, DPM++ 2M SDE Karras.

Now produce final answer with sections.
...done thinking.

**Positive Prompt**  
```
high‑resolution ultra‑realistic photograph of a single pair of sleek black‑and‑white running shoes with teal accent piping, white flat laces, breathable mesh upper and padded tongue, thick white/gray cushioned midsole with subtle flex‑grooves, black hybrid‑tread rubber outsole, brand‑new condition, placed on a deep‑red hardwood tabletop (visible grain, light varnish), a dark charcoal hardcover book with gold‑foil title lying to the left, soft diffused neutral lighting, shallow depth of field, slight elevated 30° camera angle showing toe‑box, midsole and outsole, background softly blurred to reveal an urban paved sidewalk with at least five casually dressed people standing side‑by‑side, a metallic shoe‑testing rig on the right with L‑shaped clamps gripping a duplicate shoe, lever arm applying downward force, small sensor modules and a faint green digital read‑out, neutral light‑grey wall behind, crisp focus, photorealistic, 8K‑style detail, studio‑quality product shot meets technical test environment, award‑winning composition, highly detailed, 4k‑wallpaper quality
```

**Negative Prompt**  
```
low‑resolution, blurry, out‑of‑focus, over‑exposed or under‑exposed lighting, harsh shadows, cartoon, anime, illustration, painting, sketch, watercolor, oil‑paint, line‑art, grainy, noisy, pixelated, compression artifacts, watermark, text overlay, logo, brand name visible, unrealistic colours, oversaturation, neon glow, lens flare, motion blur, fisheye distortion, extreme perspective, tilt‑shift, double‑exposure, vignette, background clutter, kitchen or bathroom setting, indoor carpet, wooden floor instead of red table, plain white background, missing book, missing testing rig, people not present, shoe worn or dirty, missing laces, missing toe‑box detail
```

**Step Count**  
`45` steps (provides a good balance of detail and generation speed)

**CFG Scale**  
`7.0` (strong adherence to the prompt while still allowing creative nuance)

**Suggested Image Dimensions**  
Portrait orientation works best to capture the table, shoe, book and background:  
`768 × 1024` pixels (or upscale to `1152 × 1536` for extra detail)

**Best Stable Diffusion Model**  
`Stable Diffusion XL 1.0 (sdxl_base_1.0)` – delivers excellent photorealistic quality, fine texture rendering, and accurate colour reproduction needed for the shoe materials, wood grain and subtle lighting.

**Best Scheduler**  
`DPM++ 2M SDE Karras` – gives sharp, clean edges and preserves fine details (mesh texture, outsole tread, sensor read‑out) while keeping the diffusion process stable.

**How to use the information in InvokeAI**

1. **Load the model**  
   ```bash
   invokeai --model sdxl_base_1.0
   ```

2. **Set the scheduler** (if using the UI, select *DPM++ 2M SDE Karras* from the scheduler dropdown).

3. **Enter the prompts**  
   - Paste the *Positive Prompt* into the “Prompt” field.  
   - Paste the *Negative Prompt* into the “Negative Prompt” field.

4. **Configure generation settings**  
   - Steps: `45`  
   - CFG Scale: `7.0`  
   - Width × Height: `768` × 1024 (or the higher upscale version)  
   - Sampler: `DPM++ 2M SDE Karras`  

5. **Generate** – click “Run” (or press **Enter**) and wait for the image. If you need more detail, you can upscale the result with a separate upscaler (e.g., `Real‑ESRGAN 4x`).

Enjoy a photo‑realistic product‑plus‑testing‑environment render that matches the exhaustive description!
