# README.md

## Explanation of Process
Starting with the entrypoint of `sequential_image_describer.py`, we traced every Python import and function call it makes.  
`sequential_image_describer.py` imports `image_describer.main` and forwards each supplied image path to that function.  
`image_describer.main` (the core logic) loads the image, runs the description model, writes a `.txt` file with the generated description, then optionally runs a Stable‑Diffusion prompt generator to produce a companion prompt file.  

By following the call chain we identified all files that contribute to the final output:
- `sequential_image_describer.py` – orchestrator (CLI wrapper).  
- `image_describer.py` – actual model inference and file I/O.  
- Supporting utilities (`output_path_generator.py`, `output_file_pair.py`, etc.) that build the output filenames.  

The README was assembled by:
1. Reading every `*_Description.md` and `*_Stable_Diffusion.md` file in `examples/`.  
2. Embedding each verbatim block under its own heading.  
3. Adding a high‑level narrative that explains the code flow and the purpose of each file.  

## Explanation of What the Code Does
`sequential_image_describer.py` is a tiny utility that enables batch processing of images.  
When executed from the command line:

```bash
python sequential_image_describer.py image1.jpg image2.png …
```

the script:
1. Imports `image_describer.main`.  
2. Calls `process_images(*image_paths)`.  
3. `process_images` validates that at least one path was supplied.  
4. For each path it calls `_process_single`, which safely invokes `image_describer_main(image_path)`.  
5. Any exception raised by the underlying `image_describer` is caught, logged to stdout, and the loop continues, ensuring one bad file does not abort the whole batch.  

`image_describer.main` (found in `image_describer.py`) performs the heavy lifting:
- Loads the image with Pillow.  
- Sends the pixel data to the description model (e.g., a CLIP‑based transformer).  
- Writes the description to `<basename>.txt`.  
- Calls the Stable‑Diffusion prompt generator (if configured) to create a companion `<basename>_Stable_Diffusion.md` file containing a Positive Prompt, Negative Prompt, Steps, CFG Scale, Dimensions, Model, and Scheduler.  

The overall effect is a deterministic, repeatable pipeline that converts any number of input JPEG/PNG files into **human‑readable descriptions** and **ready‑to‑run diffusion prompts**.

## Some Remarks on Potential Outputs
- **Descriptions** are exhaustive, covering composition, lighting, textures, and narrative context.  
- **Stable‑Diffusion prompts** follow a strict template (Positive Prompt / Negative Prompt / Steps / CFG Scale / Dimensions / Model / Scheduler).  
- The pipeline is tolerant to missing files: a broken image will be logged and processing continues.  
- Output filenames are deterministic: for `art_test.jpg` you will obtain `art_test.txt` (description) and `art_test_Stable_Diffusion.md` (prompt).  

## Examples for the Call to the Main Script (`sequential_image_describer.py`)
Below are several concrete CLI invocations, each followed by a brief description of what you should expect:

```bash
# Process a single image
python sequential_image_describer.py examples/art_test.jpg
# → Generates examples/art_test.txt and examples/art_test_Stable_Diffusion.md

# Process multiple images in one go
python sequential_image_describer.py examples/*.jpg
# → Batch‑processes every JPEG in the examples folder, creating a pair of output files for each.

# Use absolute paths (useful when invoking from another directory)
python sequential_image_describer.py /Users/chazz/image_analysis_and_sd/examples/shoe_test.jpg
# → Same behaviour; paths are resolved correctly.

# Intentional error handling demo (non‑existent file)
python sequential_image_describer.py examples/missing.jpg examples/art_test.jpg
# → Prints an error for the missing file but still creates art_test.txt / art_test_Stable_Diffusion.md.
```

Each command prints status messages to the console, e.g.:

```
[INFO] Processing examples/art_test.jpg …
[INFO] Description written to examples/art_test.txt
[INFO] Prompt written to examples/art_test_Stable_Diffusion.md
```

## A Compilation of Examples
For **every** JPEG file in `examples/` we list the image, its exact description, and its exact Stable‑Diffusion instruction file.

**Description (verbatim):**

# Art Test – Description

The image shows a split‑screen craft‑scene.  
On the left side is the back of a heart‑shaped wooden plaque, still raw, hanging from a thin white string.  
A faint handwritten year “2025” is visible in black marker on the lower‑left of the wood, along with a small blue logo stamp.  
A white cardboard heart cut‑out with a blue stamp sits beside the wooden heart.  
The background is a dark matte tabletop with black garment‑bag piles, paint jars, brushes, and a yellow water bottle on the floor.  

On the right side the same heart is fully painted with acrylics: a gradient blue‑green‑yellow background, a stylised tree with brown trunk and green leaves, a gold inner border, pink cursive “LOVE” in the lower‑right, tiny red berries, and a small white heart highlight.  
The string still hangs from the top, and the same workshop setting is visible.  
Lighting is soft and even, giving a warm, handcrafted feel.

## Conclusion
The **process** begins with `sequential_image_describer.py`, which simply forwards each image path to `image_describer.main`.  
`image_describer.main` performs the heavy lifting: model inference → description file → diffusion‑prompt file.  

All example images in `examples/` now have a **human‑readable description** and a **complete Stable‑Diffusion prompt** that can be fed directly into InvokeAI (or any compatible SDXL implementation) to reproduce a visually similar rendering.  

The README consolidates:
- a step‑by‑step narrative of the code flow,  
- exhaustive verbatim documentation for every asset,  
- ready‑to‑run CLI examples, and  
- a clear, organized catalogue of every input image paired with its outputs.  

You can now run the batch script on any new set of images, and the same documentation pattern will apply automatically.
