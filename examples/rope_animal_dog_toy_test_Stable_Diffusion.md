Thinking...
User wants: "Based on the following image description, provide information suitable for recreating it in InvokeAI. Include the following: Positive Prompt, Negative Prompt, Step Count, CFG Scale, Suggested Image Dimensions, and an idea on the best stable diffusion model to use and the best scheduler: Thinking..."

We need to produce a prompt for InvokeAI to recreate the described image. Should include positive prompt (detailed description), negative prompt (undesired elements), step count, CFG scale, dimensions, recommended model and scheduler.

We have the exhaustive description we just wrote. Now need to condense into prompts.

Positive prompt: describe dog with rope animal toy, indoor/outdoor hybrid, natural light, brown/black dog, rope toy braided, knotted, cat-head snake-body, other toys, robot with red ball, 19-year-old male with leash, etc.

Negative prompt: avoid cartoonish style, avoid low resolution, avoid blurry background beyond needed, avoid unrealistic colors, avoid extra people, avoid text overlays, avoid watermarks, avoid overly saturated, avoid distortion, avoid extra limbs.

Step count typical 30-50. CFG scale maybe 7-9. Dimensions maybe 1024x1024 or 1152x896 for landscape? Since scene is somewhat portrait? Could be 768x1024. We'll suggest 768x1024 for vertical orientation.

Model: stable diffusion XL 1.0 (sdxl) or SD 1.5? Best to capture detail: stable diffusion XL 1.0 or SDXL Turbo? Maybe SDXL 1.0 with "photorealistic" style. Scheduler: DPM++ 2M Karras for quality.

Provide final answer.

...done thinking.

**InvokeAI Generation Settings**

| Setting | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Positive Prompt** | **photorealistic, ultra‑sharp focus on a medium‑large brown‑and‑black dog (Labrador‑type) standing on a light‑coloured indoor floor that opens to a bright outdoor garden.** The dog’s head is turned upward, eyes bright, tongue lolling, ears perked and its front teeth firmly gripping a **thick‑braided rope‑animal toy**. The rope is tan/orange‑yellow, knotted at both ends, shaped like a **snake‑body with a small cat‑like head** (hybrid animal), slightly frayed at the bite point but otherwise in excellent condition. Scattered around are additional dog toys – rubber squeakers, a plush bone, a colourful chew ring and a red rubber fetch ball. In the lower‑left corner a **19‑year‑old male** in casual clothing holds a leash, slightly out‑of‑focus, supervising the play. To the right, a sleek black **testing robot** sits on a wooden platform, its cylindrical arm holding the red fetch ball, hinting at a product‑durability test. Soft natural daylight streams from the side, creating gentle shadows; the background shows blurred green foliage and a blue sky. Warm earth tones dominate, with accent colours of orange‑yellow (rope), red (robot ball) and subtle blues/greens in the foliage. **Sharp teeth, detailed fur texture, realistic rope braid, shallow depth of field, off‑centre composition, eye‑level perspective**. |
| **Negative Prompt** | cartoon, anime, illustration, low‑resolution, blurry, oversaturated, unrealistic skin tones, extra limbs, duplicated objects, text overlay, watermark, lens flare, grainy, motion blur, over‑sharpened edges, plastic‑looking rope, metallic dog, neon colours, fog, smoke, heavy vignette, HDR artifacts, unrealistic shadows, background clutter beyond toys, additional people, unrealistic robot design, sci‑fi armour, exaggerated facial expression |
| **Steps** | **45** |
| **CFG Scale** | **7.5** |
| **Image Dimensions** | **768 × 1024** (portrait orientation – captures the dog and toy prominently while allowing space for the garden backdrop) |
| **Suggested Model** | **Stable Diffusion XL 1.0** (or the latest SDXL‑Turbo if faster generation is needed). SDXL provides the detail needed for realistic fur, rope texture, and the subtle indoor‑outdoor lighting. |
| **Best Scheduler** | **DPM++ 2M Karras** (gives high‑quality results with good detail preservation and smooth gradients) |

### How to Use

1. **Open InvokeAI** and select the **SDXL 1.0** model (or SDXL‑Turbo).  
2. Set the **Scheduler** to **DPM++ 2M Karras**.  
3. Paste the **Positive Prompt** into the *Prompt* field and the **Negative Prompt** into the *Negative Prompt* field.  
4. Adjust **Steps** to **45** and **CFG Scale** to **7.5**.  
5. Set the **Width** to **768** and **Height** to **1024**.  
6. Click **Generate**.

The result should be a photorealistic, tightly‑focused image of a happy brown‑and‑black dog playing with a detailed rope‑animal toy, surrounded by a realistic indoor‑outdoor environment, a supervising human, and a subtle robotic testing setup—all rendered with the fidelity that SDXL provides. Enjoy!
