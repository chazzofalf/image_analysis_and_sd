# Document Examples Action
Create a README.md in the examples folder that contains the following sections
## Explaination of Process
Starting with the entrypoint of `sequential_image_describer.py` and following any python code that it references list the following
You may reference the main README.md, at the root folder of this project, to help contextually inform this documentation process.
### Explaination of What the Code Does
Be very detailed, exacting, exhaustively, narrative about this.
### Some remarks on potential outputs
Be very detailed, exacting, exhaustively, narrative about this.
### Examples for the call to the main script. `sequential_image_describer.py`
Be very detailed, exacting, exhaustively, narrative about this. List many examples. Use the jpeg files in the example folders to guide this section.
## A Compilation of Examples
### For Every Input Output Group
For every JPEG file `${NAME}.jpg` along side with its related description `${NAME}_Description.md` and its related potential stable diffusion generation instructions `${NAME}_Stable_Diffusion.md` List the following grouped under headings of very human readable versions of `${NAME}`
#### A Display of the image
#### A Verbatim (Exact) Copy of the image's description
#### A Verbatim (Exact) Copy of the image's potential stable diffusion generation instruction
## Finally a conclusion that neatly ties it all together.
Be very detailed, exacting, exhaustively, narrative about this.
