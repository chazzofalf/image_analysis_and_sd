Thinking...
The user wants: "Based on the following image description, provide information suitable for recreating it in InvokeAI. Include the following: Positive Prompt, Negative Prompt, Step Count, CFG Scale, Suggested Image Dimensions, and an idea on the best stable diffusion model to use and the best scheduler." Actually earlier the user said "Combine the following descriptions into a single, very long and detailed exhaustive description". Wait: The user gave two instructions? Let's re-read: The user first said: "Based on the following image description, provide information suitable for recreating it in InvokeAI. Include the following: Positive Prompt, Negative Prompt, Step Count, CFG Scale, Suggested Image Dimensions, and an idea on the best stable diffusion model to use and the best scheduler: Thinking...". Then later "Combine the following descriptions into a single, very long and detailed exhaustive description". The user might be confused. The instruction is to combine the descriptions into a single description. But the first instruction is about InvokeAI parameters. The user wrote both. I need to decide what to output. The final request: "Combine the following descriptions into a single, very long and detailed exhaustive description". That seems to be the final instruction. But the first line says "Based on the following image description, provide information suitable for recreating it in InvokeAI...". The user might want both: Provide the combined description and also the InvokeAI parameters.

Probably they want both: a combined exhaustive description and then the InvokeAI settings.

Thus answer should include a huge description (the combination we already wrote) and then at the end provide Positive Prompt, Negative Prompt, steps, CFG, dimensions, model, scheduler.

We'll use a model like "Stable Diffusion XL (v1.0)" or "SDXL 1.0" with "Euler a" or "DPM++ 2M Karras". Provide suggestions.

Positive prompt will incorporate all details. Negative prompt will remove unwanted things like "blurred faces, lowres, watermark, text, jpeg artifacts". Provide step count 30-45. CFG 7-9. Dimensions 1024x1024 or 1152x896 for more horizontal? The scene is somewhat horizontal, maybe 1024x1152. Provide suggestion.

Let's craft final.
...done thinking.

**Combined, Exhaustive Visual Description**

The scene is a richly staged tabletop tableau that fuses modern everyday objects with the mythic aura of a lost civilization, all set against a softly‑blurred, underwater‑ruin backdrop. Every element is rendered with painstaking detail, from the texture of leather‑bound books to the glistening fur of a dog, creating a layered narrative of curiosity, guardianship, and the fluid nature of knowledge.

---

### 1. Overall Composition & Perspective
- **Viewpoint:** Slightly elevated, front‑right angle looking down onto a wooden (or stone‑textured) table. The camera’s depth‑of‑field is shallow: foreground objects are razor‑sharp while the background recedes into a dreamy bokeh that hints at a larger, submerged environment.  
- **Lighting:** Warm, diffused light from above‑left casts soft highlights on the tops of books, the dog’s coat, and the remote, while cooler, filtered shafts of light filter through an imagined water column, illuminating the distant ruins with a subtle blue‑green hue. Shadows fall gently to the opposite side, preserving detail in the darker zones.  

### 2. Foreground – Tabletop Arrangement  

| Item | Position | Visual Details |
|------|----------|----------------|
| **Atlas (Primary Book)** | Center‑front, flat on the table, front cover facing the viewer | Hard‑cover, dark matte background, bold white capital lettering “ATLAS”. Spine mirrors the cover, edged with faint gold/brass tooling that catches light. |
| **Lost Empire: Atlantis (Secondary Book)** | Slightly behind and overlapping the Atlas, opened to a spread | Dark, almost black leather cover with large white block Chinese title **“失落的帝国：亚特兰蒂斯”**; smaller blue subtitle **“亚特兰蒂斯”** beneath. Leather shows creases, scuffs, and a delicate gold filigree border. Spine adorned with raised brass‑tone embossing and a polished eye‑like emblem. Open pages are thick, yellowed parchment, textured with a fibrous grain. Black‑and‑white engravings depict sea‑creatures, crumbling columns, and celestial charts; faint water‑streaks and tiny bubbles run across the surface, as if the page is partially submerged. |
| **Atlantis (Novel)** | Right of the Atlas, opened flat | Crisp white cover with bold black title **“Atlantis”** across the top; smaller black subtitle **“A Novel of Discovery”** underneath. Pages immaculate, stark white, contrasting sharply with the aged parchment of the Lost Empire book. |
| **Dog** | Perched on the open Lost Empire pages, front‑center | Large black‑and‑white dog (tuxedo‑coat appearance), relaxed yet alert. Head turned toward the camera, ears perked, eyes bright. Fur glossy where the light hits; paws gently rest on the parchment, giving the impression of a guardian of ancient knowledge. |
| **Rectangular Box** | Hovering just above the right side of the Lost Empire spread | Small matte‑finished rectangular container, surface marked with faint fingerprints, suggesting recent handling. |
| **Remote Control** | Near the Atlas’s right edge | Sleek black remote with a few illuminated buttons; subtle specular highlights on its smooth surface. |
| **Chair** | Foreground, left of the table, slightly angled toward the camera | Simple wooden chair, legs visible, seat turned inward as if inviting someone to sit. |
| **Human Figures** | Slightly recessed behind the books | **Figure A (left‑rear):** Back partially turned, leaning forward as if adjusting a page. **Figure B (right‑rear):** Standing with shoulders squared, hands loosely clasped. Both dressed casually, bathed in the same warm ambient light, suggesting an intimate, scholarly setting. |
| **Table Surface** | Entire foreground | Warm wood grain (or stone speckle) with fine texture; light catches the subtle ridges, enhancing tactile realism. |

### 3. Mid‑ground – Atmospheric Background  

- **Blurred Ruins:** Soft, out‑of‑focus silhouettes of ancient architecture – fluted columns, broken arches, weathered statues – hint at a Greco‑Roman style now reclaimed by the sea. The ruins are rendered in cool blues, teals, and muted greys, providing a strong contrast to the warm foreground.  
- **Underwater Motifs:** Light shafts filter through an imagined water column, creating a watery haze. Translucent shapes reminiscent of coral, sea‑weed, and distant fish drift lazily, reinforcing the mythic “Atlantis” ambience.  
- **Fog & Mist:** A pale, ethereal mist drifts across the lower part of the background, softening the edges of the ruins and adding depth. The mist catches the ambient light, forming a faint luminous halo around the central tableau.  

### 4. Colour Palette & Textures  

| Element | Dominant Colours | Textural Highlights |
|---------|------------------|---------------------|
| Atlas Cover | Dark matte (near‑black), white lettering | Smooth cardboard, slight wear |
| Lost Empire Leather | Deep black/brown leather, gold/bronze tooling, blue subtitle | Grainy leather, raised embossing |
| Parchment Pages | Warm ochre, yellowed edges | Rough, fibrous paper fibers |
| Atlantis Novel | Pure white pages, black cover | Glossy cover, crisp paper |
| Dog Fur | Black and white, glossy highlights | Soft, thick fur |
| Table Surface | Warm wood/stone tones | Fine grain or speckled stone |
| Background Ruins | Cool blues, teals, muted greys | Ghost‑like outlines |
| Water Effects | Gradient blues → teal → emerald, translucent bubbles | Fluid, flowing, subtle ripple |
| Light Highlights | Warm amber on spines, cool white on water | Sharp glints on metal (remote, gold tooling) |

### 5. Narrative & Symbolic Impressions  

- **Confluence of Knowledge:** The modern “Atlas” sits beside the mythic “Lost Empire: Atlantis”, linking contemporary geography with timeless legend.  
- **Guardian Presence:** The dog, perched protectively on the ancient parchment, acts as a sentinel of forgotten wisdom.  
- **Human Curiosity:** The two partially visible figures suggest a quiet, collaborative inquiry into the mysteries laid before them.  
- **Temporal Layers:** Modern objects (remote, chair) coexist with aged books and an underwater ruin backdrop, creating a visual dialogue across centuries.  
- **Elemental Fusion:** Water subtly permeates the scene—through colour, texture, and background—symbolising the fluidity of knowledge and the notion that truth can be hidden beneath layers of time.

### 6. Technical Qualities  

- **Resolution & Sharpness:** Foreground items are captured in high resolution, allowing legibility of every letter on spines, fur strand, and remote button.  
- **Depth of Field:** Shallow, isolating the tabletop while the background remains an impressionistic tableau.  
- **Dynamic Range:** Balanced highlights (gold tooling, remote) and deep shadows (under the dog, table underside) preserve detail throughout.
