Thinking...
We need to provide info for recreating in InvokeAI: Positive Prompt, Negative Prompt, Step Count, CFG Scale, Suggested Image Dimensions, and best stable diffusion model and scheduler. So after description, we give prompts.

We should craft a positive prompt describing scene: Sony e-reader with screen showing Atlantis text, burgundy leather case, purple leather bound book with red ribbon, white paperback with pink ribbon, wooden table, soft ambient lighting, shallow depth of field, etc. Negative prompt: avoid clutter, blur background, no people, no watermarks, no text artifacts, no distortion, no oversaturation, no overexposure.

Step count typical 30-50. CFG scale maybe 7-8. Dimensions maybe 768x1024 (portrait). Model: stable diffusion XL 1.0 or SDXL 1.0 or 1.0 base, maybe "sdxl_base_1.0" or "sdxl_refiner". Scheduler: DPM++ 2M Karras or Euler a. Provide best: DPM++ 2M SDE Karras for fine detail.

Let's craft final answer.
...done thinking.

**✅  QUICK‑START GUIDE FOR RE‑CREATING THE PHOTO IN INVOKEAI**

| Item | Recommended Value |
|------|-------------------|
| **Positive Prompt** | *see full prompt below* |
| **Negative Prompt** | *see full prompt below* |
| **Steps** | **45** (gives enough refinement for fine text on the e‑reader while keeping a natural shallow‑depth‑of‑field look) |
| **CFG Scale** | **7.5** (strong enough to lock the composition, still allows a touch of creativity) |
| **Image Size** | **768 × 1024 px** (portrait orientation – matches the natural way a reader holds an e‑reader) |
| **Best Model** | **Stable Diffusion XL 1.0 (sdxl_base_1.0)** – excellent at rendering realistic devices, leather textures and crisp typography. |
| **Best Scheduler** | **DPM++ 2M Karras** (or DPM++ SDE Karras) – produces clean edges on the screen/UI and smooth, natural bokeh for the background. |

## 🎨  POSITIVE PROMPT (one‑line, ready to paste)

```
Sony e‑reader with matte white body and thin silver bezel, wrapped in a dark burgundy leather case with subtle stitching, screen glowing with a crisp white page titled "Atlantis" – black serif text describing the mythic sinking of the island, includes "11 of 159" page indicator, UI icons "OPTIONS", battery, navigation arrows, placed on a light‑oak wooden tabletop, soft diffused indoor lighting, shallow depth of field, background gently blurred, behind the e‑reader a large purple leather‑bound book with gold lettering, red silk ribbon bookmark peeking over the top edge, to the left a white paperback titled "Atlantis: The Lost Empire" opened to its front cover, pink ribbon bookmark tucked near the top, subtle shadows cast by a warm overhead light, composition centred, slight top‑down angle, realistic photography, ultra‑sharp focus on screen text and leather textures, vivid but natural colour palette, no people, no logos other than Sony, no watermarks.
```

*(You can copy‑paste the whole line into the “Prompt” field.  If you prefer a shorter version, keep the first ~150 words – the most important visual cues are already there.)*

## 🚫  NEGATIVE PROMPT (to keep the image clean)

```
blurred text, illegible UI, distorted screen, low‑resolution, pixelated, over‑exposed highlights, harsh shadows, lens flare, grain, noise, JPEG artifacts, watermarks, signatures, text on the book covers, extra objects (cups, glasses, pens), people, pets, plants, background clutter, cartoon style, anime, painterly, oil paint, sketch, line art, low‑poly, 3D render, unrealistic proportions, oversaturated colours, neon glow, vignette, motion blur, double exposure, text cut‑off, missing leather stitching, missing ribbon, wrong book titles.
```

## 📌  QUICK TIPS FOR THE BEST RESULT

1. **Render the screen text first** – the SDXL model is good at generating readable typography when the prompt explicitly mentions “crisp black serif text, page indicator, UI icons”. If the text still looks fuzzy, run a second “refine” pass using the **SDXL Refiner** model with a low CFG (≈ 4) and the same prompt.

2. **Use the “seed” feature** if you want to experiment reproducibly. A good starting seed is `123456789`.

3. **Adjust the “strength” of the background blur** (if you enable img2img) to around `0.55` – this keeps the foreground razor‑sharp while giving a natural bokeh.

4. **Post‑processing (optional)** – a light “sharpen” or “clarity” filter (10‑15 % strength) in an external editor can make the e‑reader’s UI even clearer without breaking the overall realism.

5. **If the purple leather book appears too flat**, add a tiny extra prompt token: “high‑gloss subtle sheen on leather” or “soft rim lighting on the book spine”.

### 🎉  You’re ready!

Paste the positive prompt, negative prompt, and the parameters above into InvokeAI, hit **Generate**, and you should obtain a photorealistic rendering that matches the exhaustive description: a quiet, scholarly scene where modern digital reading meets classic leather‑bound tomes, all bathed in gentle indoor light. Happy generating!
