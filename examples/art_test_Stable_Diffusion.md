Thinking...
We need to provide info suitable for recreating it in InvokeAI: Positive Prompt, Negative Prompt, Step Count, CFG Scale, Suggested Image Dimensions, best stable diffusion model, best scheduler. Also need to give the exhaustive description we just crafted.

So output should include those sections. Provide a detailed prompt based on the description. Also negative prompt typical: low quality, artifacts, etc.

Model: maybe "Stable Diffusion XL 1.0" or "sdxl 1.0". Scheduler: DPM++ 2M Karras or Euler a. Provide dimensions maybe 1024x1024 or 1152x896.

We'll give steps 30-50.

Let's craft.

...done thinking.

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Positive Prompt** | `a highly detailed, surreal composite illustration, a white rectangular photograph with a thin matte black border, slightly tilted to the right, showing a bright white interior wall with a single clear window. In the room a lowâ€‘profile modern couch holds a flatâ€‘screen TV, a simple wooden chair sits beside it, and three casually dressed people are positioned leftâ€‘centerâ€‘right. Above the couch a large white canvas is covered in bold black lineâ€‘drawings that outline a dynamic human figure. Through the window a tranquil natural scene is visible: vibrant green grass, a soft blue sky dotted with fluffy clouds, a gentle hill in the distance and small rabbitâ€‘like rodents playing among the grass. Over this landscape a semiâ€‘transparent dreamâ€‘like digital painting floats: an abstract female figure merging with stylized foliage, fragmented architectural elements, glowing amber and cyan orbs, a calm indigoâ€‘blue body of water and dark wingâ€‘like silhouettes. Far beyond the hill a duskâ€‘lit futuristic cityscape stretches under a twilight sky of orangeâ€‘pink fading to deep purple, sleek glass skyscrapers edged with neon cyan, magenta and amber, a reflective river and quiet street with pedestrians. In the lowerâ€‘left corner an inset shows an artistâ€™s wooden palette with thick piles of vivid red, yellow, green, blue and white paint. Opposite that, a realistic landscape painting of earthy trees, a clear sky and a hazy lake is displayed. In the upperâ€‘right a minimalist digital artwork of bold clean lines in shades of blue, gray and white creates an industrial geometry. At the centre a semiâ€‘abstract humanoid formed from circles, ellipses, straight lines and soft earthâ€‘tone blobs hovers, bridging realism and abstraction. The whole scene is bathed in mixed lighting: warm daylight from the window, cool neon glows, soft twilight, and ethereal orb illumination, with a balanced colour palette of muted whites, greys and pastels punctuated by vibrant reds, oranges, blues and greens. ultraâ€‘high resolution, cinematic composition, intricate depth of field, 8k, photorealistic details, painterly brushstrokes, subtle film grain` |
| **Negative Prompt** | `lowâ€‘resolution, blurry, pixelated, jpeg artifacts, overâ€‘exposed highlights, underâ€‘exposed shadows, colour banding, bad anatomy, extra limbs, distorted faces, text, watermark, signature, logo, frame inside frame, double exposure, lens flare overkill, oversaturation, cartoonish, anime style, clipping, grainy, noise, motion blur, NSFW, gore, violence` |
| **Steps** | `45` |
| **CFG Scale** | `7.5` |
| **Sampler / Scheduler** | `DPM++ 2M Karras` (excellent for preserving fine detail while handling complex layered compositions) |
| **Model** | `Stable Diffusion XL 1.0` (or the newer `sdxlâ€‘turbo` if you need faster generation; XLâ€™s higher capacity handles the many distinct visual styles in one image) |
| **Image Dimensions** | `1152â€¯Ã—â€¯896` (a 4:3 ratio gives enough horizontal space for the interiorâ€‘exteriorâ€‘city panorama while keeping the canvasâ€‘inset details sharp) |
| **Seed** | `Leave empty for random or set a specific seed if you want reproducibility` |

### ðŸ“– Exhaustive Unified Description (for reference or further tweaking)

> The image is a whiteâ€‘bordered photograph, slightly tilted, that opens onto a bright white wall with a lone window letting in soft daylight. A low couch with a flatâ€‘screen TV rests against the wall, flanked by a simple chair; three casually dressed people occupy the space, one near the left edge, one central, and one near the right. Above the couch hangs a large white canvas streaked with bold black lines that sketch a figure in motion. Through the window the eye travels outward to a tranquil meadow of green grass under a blue sky dotted with clouds, a gentle hill in the distance, and a few rabbitâ€‘like creatures darting among the blades. Over this vista, a semiâ€‘transparent digital painting unfurls: an abstracted woman whose flowing form dissolves into stylized foliage, interlaced with angular architectural fragments, glowing amber and cyan orbs, a calm indigo waterway, and dark wingâ€‘like shapes sweeping the upper right. Beyond the hill, a duskâ€‘lit city rises, its skyscrapers glowing with neon accents, a river reflecting the twilight palette, and a quiet street threaded with pedestrians and parked cars. In the lower left inset, an artistâ€™s wooden palette displays thick, vivid piles of red, yellow, green, blue, and white paint, the texture of the medium palpable. Opposite that, a realistic landscape painting shows earthy trees and bushes in the foreground, a serene sky above, and a hazy lake receding into distance. Over the upper right corner, a minimalist digital composition of stark blue, gray, and white lines creates an industrial, coolâ€‘toned geometry. Finally, at the centre, an abstract humanoid form composed of circles, straight lines, and soft earthâ€‘tone blobs hovers, bridging the realistic and the surreal.  
>   
> The whole composition functions as a layered collage: the interior room grounds the scene in everyday reality; the canvas with black line drawing and the artistâ€™s palette speak to the act of making art; the natural view through the window, the distant city, and the traditional landscape painting reference the external world; the dreamâ€‘like digital painting, the minimalist geometry, and the abstract figure express inner imagination, memory, and subconscious feeling. Light shifts from warm daylight to cool neon to ethereal glows, while color moves from muted whites and greys to vibrant reds, oranges, blues and greens, uniting the disparate elements into a single, sprawling visual narrative that feels simultaneously intimate, expansive, realistic, and surreal.  

Feel free to copyâ€‘paste the **Positive Prompt** into InvokeAI, adjust the seed or dimensions if you need a different aspect ratio, and hit **Generate**. The result should give you a richly layered, highâ€‘detail illustration that matches the exhaustive description above. Enjoy! ðŸŽ¨ðŸš€
