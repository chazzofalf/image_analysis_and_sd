Thinking...
We need to provide info suitable for recreating in InvokeAI: Positive Prompt, Negative Prompt, Step Count, CFG Scale, Suggested Image Dimensions, best model, best scheduler. Use description above to craft prompts.

Positive Prompt should include: interior window frame, view of quiet suburban street, overcast sky, asphalt with cracks, few parked cars (silver sedan, white compact), sidewalk, grass strip, street lamp, two-story white houses, imposing grey building, trees, soft diffused light, grainy texture, etc.

Negative Prompt: avoid people, avoid bright sunshine, avoid heavy rain, avoid night, avoid high contrast, avoid cartoonish style, avoid unrealistic colors, avoid lens flare, avoid HDR, avoid overexposure, avoid futuristic cyberpunk, avoid anime.

Step Count maybe 30-50. CFG Scale around 7-9. Dimensions maybe 768x512 or 1024x768 (portrait?). The window orientation suggests vertical orientation? Might be landscape. Suggest 768x1024? Usually stable diffusion works with multiples of 64. Could suggest 768x1024 (portrait) or 1024x768 (landscape). Since window vertical frame, maybe portrait. Provide both.

Best model: stable diffusion XL 1.0 or 1.5? For realistic photorealistic interior/outdoor view, use SDXL 1.0 or 1.0 base. Or "Stable Diffusion 2.1" or "Stable Diffusion 1.5"? For high realism, SDXL 1.0 or "Stable Diffusion 2.1". Scheduler: Euler a or DPM++ 2M Karras. Provide recommendation.

Now craft final answer.
...done thinking.

**InvokeAI “re‑creation” package**  

Below you will find everything you need to generate an image that matches the description of **outside_window_streetview_test.jpg** – from the exact wording of the prompts to the technical settings that give the best‑looking result.

## 1️⃣ Positive Prompt (what *should* be in the picture)

```
high‑detail interior view through a dark wooden window frame, faint glass reflections showing light‑colored curtains and a glimpse of a sofa, grainy mobile‑phone style photo, soft overcast daylight, quiet residential street, smooth asphalt road with fine cracks and small potholes, thin concrete sidewalk, narrow strip of overgrown grass, solitary silver streetlamp on the left, a silver sedan parked at the curb, a white compact car parked a few metres away, no pedestrians, two‑story white houses with pastel accents, central imposing modern grey building with large reflective windows, mature deciduous trees with full green foliage lining both sides, diffuse gray sky, muted pastel colour palette, low contrast, photorealistic, 35 mm film‑like depth of field, slight vignette, subtle film grain
```

*Tips*  
- Keep the order of elements roughly as they appear from foreground → background – this helps the model “place” everything correctly.  
- The phrase **“grainy mobile‑phone style photo”** and **“35 mm film‑like depth of field”** coax the sampler into adding the soft texture and shallow focus that are characteristic of the source image.

---

## 2️⃣ Negative Prompt (what *must NOT* appear)

```
people, crowds, bicycles, motorcycles, traffic jam, rain, snow, puddles, wet street, bright sunshine, harsh shadows, lens flare, HDR, cartoon, anime, illustration, painting, low‑resolution, blurred, oversaturated colours, neon, futuristic, cyberpunk, sci‑fi, night, indoor lighting, ceiling lights, window blinds fully closed, plants inside, wallpaper patterns, text, watermarks
```

*Why?*  
All of these elements would break the calm, empty‑street, overcast daytime mood that the original image conveys.

## 3️⃣ Sampling Settings  

| Setting | Recommended Value | Reason |
|---------|-------------------|--------|
| **Steps** | **45** | Gives enough diffusion time for the many distinct objects (window frame, cars, buildings, trees) to settle without over‑smoothing. |
| **CFG Scale** | **7.5** | Balances adherence to the prompt (high enough to keep the scene faithful) with a little creative freedom for realistic lighting and grain. |
| **Sampler** | **Euler‑a** (or **DPM++ 2M Karras** if you prefer a slightly sharper finish) | Euler‑a handles fine structural detail (cracks, window borders) very well, while DPM++ 2M Karras can be used for a crisp, photoreal look. |
| **Scheduler** | **Karras** (default for most SDXL pipelines) | Provides smoother convergence and more natural‑looking depth‑of‑field blur. |
| **Seed** | *Leave blank for random* (or set a fixed seed if you want reproducibility) | Random seeds usually give pleasant variations; a fixed seed is handy for iterative tweaking. |

---

## 4️⃣ Image Dimensions  

The original scene is taller than it is wide (a window‑frame portrait orientation). Use a resolution that respects the 64‑pixel grid requirement:

- **Portrait (recommended)** – **768 × 1024** or **1024 × 1536** for extra detail.  
- **Landscape (if you prefer a wider view)** – **1024 × 768** (keep the same aspect ratio but rotate the composition).

Both sizes preserve the fine details of the window frame and the street while staying well within typical VRAM limits (≈6 GB for SDXL‑1.0).

---

## 5️⃣ Model Choice – Which checkpoint works best?

| Model | Why it fits |
|-------|-------------|
| **Stable Diffusion XL 1.0** (or the newer **XL 1.0‑refiner**) | XL’s larger latent space and improved depth‑of‑field handling produce very realistic outdoor‑through‑window shots with proper glass reflections and subtle grain. |
| **Stable Diffusion 2.1** (if you have limited VRAM) | Still capable of photorealism and handles architectural details nicely; use the “depth‑aware” variant for a stronger sense of perspective. |
| **Stable Diffusion 1.5** (fallback) | Works, but you’ll need a stronger CFG (≈8‑9) and possibly a negative prompt tweak to keep the lighting soft. |

*Bottom line*: **SDXL 1.0** + **Euler‑a** → most faithful recreation with minimal tweaking.

## 6️⃣ Quick “One‑Click” Command (for InvokeAI CLI)

```bash
invokeai \
  --prompt "high-detail interior view through a dark wooden window frame, faint glass reflections showing light-colored curtains and a glimpse of a sofa, grainy mobile-phone style photo, soft overcast daylight, quiet residential street, smooth asphalt road with fine cracks and small potholes, thin concrete sidewalk, narrow strip of overgrown grass, solitary silver streetlamp on the left, a silver sedan parked at the curb, a white compact car parked a few metres away, no pedestrians, two-story white houses with pastel accents, central imposing modern grey building with large reflective windows, mature deciduous trees with full green foliage lining both sides, diffuse gray sky, muted pastel colour palette, low contrast, photorealistic, 35mm film-like depth of field, slight vignette, subtle film grain" \
  --negative_prompt "people, crowds, bicycles, motorcycles, traffic jam, rain, snow, puddles, bright sunshine, harsh shadows, lens flare, HDR, cartoon, anime, illustration, painting, low-resolution, blurred, oversaturated colours, neon, futuristic, cyberpunk, sci-fi, night, indoor lighting, ceiling lights, window blinds fully closed, plants inside, wallpaper patterns, text, watermarks" \
  --steps 45 \
  --cfg 7.5 \
  --sampler euler_a \
  --scheduler karras \
  --width 768 \
  --height 1024 \
  --model "sdxl_base_1.0" \
  --seed 123456789   # (optional, remove for random)
```

Feel free to adjust the seed, dimensions, or sampler to suit your hardware and aesthetic preferences. With the settings above you should end up with a photo‑realistic, slightly grainy, overcast view that matches the original **outside_window_streetview_test.jpg** almost perfectly. Happy generating!
