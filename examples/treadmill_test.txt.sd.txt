### 4. Physiological Monitoring Equipment  

#### 4.1. ECG Electrode Array  

- **Placement**: A full set of **standard 12‑lead ECG electrodes** is affixed to the patient’s chest, both upper arms, and both lower legs.  
- **Appearance**: The electrodes are small, circular, adhesive pads with a light‑gray backing. Thin, flexible wires radiate outward from each pad, forming an organized network of cables that converge toward the monitoring system.  
- **Connection**: The wires terminate in a **multi‑channel connector box** that sits on the side of the treadmill, labeled with lead names (I, II, V1‑V6, etc.).  

#### 4.2. Central Monitoring Unit (Cardiac Monitoring Machine)  

- **Form Factor**: A **large, rectangular medical monitor** positioned to the right of the treadmill, encased in a **grayish‑white chassis** with rounded corners.  
- **Screen Content**:  
  - The **primary display** shows continuous **ECG waveforms** (P‑QRS‑T complexes) scrolling from right to left in a deep green or amber trace.  
  - Adjacent sub‑panels present **vital signs**: heart rate (bpm), blood pressure (mmHg), oxygen saturation (SpO₂), and respiratory rate.  
  - A **numeric read‑out** of the current **test stage** and **target heart rate** may be displayed in the upper right corner.  
- **Interface**: The monitor includes a **touchscreen or button array** for the technician to start/stop recording, annotate events, and adjust alarm thresholds.  

#### 4.3. Computer / Tablet Interface (Software Dashboard)  

- **Location**: Directly to the right of the central monitoring unit sits a **compact laptop or tablet** (≈ 13‑inch screen) on a small rolling cart or a mounted arm.  
- **Software Window (“treadmill_test”)**:  
  - The screen displays a **software window titled “treadmill_test”** in a clean, sans‑serif font.  
  - Inside the window, the upper section contains **text fields** that likely hold patient identifiers (name, ID), test parameters (protocol type, target METs), and real‑time status messages.  
  - **Tabular Data Section**: Below the header, a **table** lists columns such as **“Time (s)”, “Distance (m)”, “Speed (km/h)”, “Calories Burned”**. At least two rows of data are visible, showing incremental values (e.g., Time = 30 s, Distance = 50 m, Speed = 5 km/h, Calories ≈ 2). The table is rendered in a light gray background with dark text, typical of functional medical software.  
  - **Graphical Plot**: Directly beneath the table, a **line graph** spans the width of the window. The **horizontal axis** runs from 0 to about 60 seconds, while the **vertical axis** is labeled “Speed (m/s)” (or an equivalent unit). Two superimposed lines are plotted: one solid line (colored **blue**) representing the **actual treadmill speed** in m/s, and a second line (perhaps **red** or **dashed**) indicating a **target or reference speed**. The graph updates in real time as the test progresses.  
  - **Overall UI Aesthetic**: The interface is utilitarian, employing a minimal color palette (white background, gray gridlines, blue/red data lines) to keep the focus on data readability rather than visual flair.

### 9. Narrative Flow (What Is Happening)  

1. **Initiation**: The patient steps onto the treadmill, electrodes are applied, and the technician verifies lead placement.  
2. **Baseline Recording**: The monitor displays a resting ECG; the software window shows initial zeroed values.  
3. **Exercise Phase**: As the treadmill speed and incline increase per protocol, the patient’s stride lengthens, his breathing becomes audible, and sweat begins to form. The ECG waveform thickens slightly, heart rate climbs, and the software table logs incremental time, distance, speed, and calories.  
4. **Data Visualization**: The graph beneath the table dynamically draws two lines— the actual speed (blue) and the target speed (red)— keeping pace with the treadmill’s adjustments.  
5. **Supervision**: The technician watches both the physical signs (patient’s expression, limb movement) and the electronic readouts (ECG, vitals) for any arrhythmias or concerning trends.  
6. **Safety Preparedness**: The oxygen tank and crash cart remain within arm’s reach, ready for immediate deployment should the patient exhibit ischemic changes or hemodynamic instability.
